<p class="dropcap">The degree to which Friendship, in the early
history of the world, has been recognised as
an institution, and the dignity ascribed to it, are
things hardly realized to-day. Yet a very slight examination
of the subject shows the important part
it has played. In making the following collection
I have been much struck by the remarkable manner
in which the customs of various races and times
illustrate each other, and the way in which they
point to a solid and enduring body of human sentiment
on the subject. By arranging the extracts in
a kind of rough chronological and evolutionary
order from those dealing with primitive races onwards,
the continuity of these customs comes out all
the more clearly, as well as their slow modification
in course of time. But it must be confessed that the
present collection is only incomplete, and a small
contribution, at best, towards a large subject.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Friendship-Customs, of a very
marked and definite character, have
apparently prevailed among a great
many primitive peoples; but the
information that we have about them is seldom
thoroughly satisfactory. Travellers have been content
to note external ceremonies, like the exchange
of names between comrades, or the mutual tasting
of each other’s blood, but—either from want of
perception or want of opportunity—have not been
able to tell us anything about the inner meaning of
these formalities, or the sentiments which may have
inspired them. Still, we have material enough to
indicate that comrade-attachment has been recognised
as an important institution, and held in high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
esteem, among quite savage tribes; and some of
the following quotations will show this. When we
come to the higher culture of the Greek age the
material fortunately is abundant—not only for the
customs, but (in Greek philosophy and poetry) for
the inner sentiments which inspired these customs.
Consequently it will be found that the major part
of this and the following two chapters deals with
matter from Greek sources. The later chapters
carry on the subject in loosely historical sequence
through the Christian centuries down to modern
times.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Primitive Ceremony</i></div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">The Balonda are an African tribe
inhabiting Londa land, among the
Southern tributaries of the Congo
River. They were visited by Livingstone,
and the following account of their customs
is derived from him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“The Balonda have a most remarkable custom
of cementing friendship. When two men
agree to be special friends they go through a singular
ceremony. The men sit opposite each other
holding hands, and by the side of each is a vessel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
of beer. Slight cuts are then made on the clasped
hands, on the pit of the stomach, on the right
cheek, and on the forehead. The point of a grass-blade
is pressed against each of these cuts, so as
to take up a little of the blood, and each man
washes the grass-blade in his own beer vessel.
The vessels are then exchanged and the contents
drunk, so that each imbibes the blood of the other.
The two are thenceforth considered as blood-relations,
and are bound to assist each other in
every possible manner. While the beer is being
drunk, the friends of each of the men beat on the
ground with clubs, and bawl out certain sentences
as ratification of the treaty. It is thought correct
for all the friends of each party to the contract to
drink a little of the beer. The ceremony is called
‘Kasendi.’ After it has been completed, gifts are
exchanged, and both parties always give their
most precious possessions.” <i>Natural History of
Man. Rev. J. G. Wood. Vol: Africa</i>, p. 419.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Exchange of Names</i></div>

<p>Among the Manganjas and other tribes of the
Zambesi region, Livingstone found the custom of
changing names prevalent.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Sininyane (a headman) had exchanged
names with a Zulu at Shupanga, and on being
called the next morning made no answer; to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
second and third summons he paid no attention;
but at length one of his men replied, ‘He is not
Sininyane now, he is Moshoshoma;’ and to this
name he answered promptly. The custom of exchanging
names with men of other tribes is not
uncommon; and the exchangers regard themselves
as close comrades, owing special duties to
each other ever after. Should one by chance visit
his comrade’s town, he expects to receive food,
lodging, and other friendly offices from him.”
<i>Narrative of an Expedition to the Zambesi. By
David and Charles Livingstone. Murray</i>, 1865,
p. 148.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>David and Jonathan</i></div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">In the story of David and Jonathan,
which follows, we have an example,
from much the same stage of primitive
tribal life, of a compact between two
friends—one the son of the chief, the other a shepherd
youth—only in this case, in the song of
David (“I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan,
thy love to me was wonderful”) we are fortunate
in having the inner feeling preserved for us.
It should be noted that Jonathan gives to David
his “most precious possessions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“And when Saul saw David go forth against
the Philistine (Goliath), he said unto Abner,
the captain of the host, ‘Abner, whose son is this
youth?’ And Abner said, ‘As thy soul liveth, O
King, I cannot tell.’ And the King said, ‘Inquire
thou whose son the stripling is.’ And as David
returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,
Abner took him and brought him before Saul,
with the head of the Philistine in his hand. And
Saul said to him, ‘Whose son art thou, young
man?’ And David answered, ‘The son of thy
servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.’</p>

<p>“And it came to pass, when he had made an
end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan
was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan
loved him as his own soul. And Saul took him
that day, and would let him go no more home to
his father’s house. Then Jonathan and David
made a covenant, because he loved him as his own
soul. And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe
that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his
garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and
to his girdle.” <i>1 Sam.</i> ch. xvii. 55.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Flower Friends</i></div>

<p>With regard to the exchange of names, a slightly
different custom prevails among the Bengali coolies.
Two youths, or two girls, will exchange two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
flowers (of the same kind) with each other, in
token of perpetual alliance. After that, one speaks
of the other as “my flower,” but never alludes to
the other by <i>name</i> again—only by some roundabout
phrase.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Polynesia Tahiti</i></div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-h.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Herman Melville, who voyaged
among the Pacific Islands in 1841-1845,
gives some interesting and reliable
accounts of Polynesian customs
of that period. He says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“The really curious way in which all the Polynesians
are in the habit of making bosom
friends at the shortest possible notice is deserving
of remark. Although, among a people like the
Tahitians, vitiated as they are by sophisticating
influences, this custom has in most cases degenerated
into a mere mercenary relation, it nevertheless
had its origin in a fine, and in some instances
heroic, sentiment formerly entertained by their
fathers.</p>

<p>“In the annals of the island (Tahiti) are examples
of extravagant friendships, unsurpassed by
the story of Damon and Pythias, in truth, much
more wonderful; for notwithstanding the devotion—even
of life in some cases—to which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
led, they were frequently entertained at first sight
for some stranger from another island.” <i>Omoo</i>,
<i>Herman Melville</i>, ch. 39, p. 154.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Though little inclined to jealousy in (ordinary)
love-matters, the Tahitian will hear of
no rivals in his friendship.” <i>Ibid</i>, ch. 40.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Marquesas Islands</i></div>

<p>Melville spent some months on one of the Marquesas
Islands, in a valley occupied by a tribe called
Typees; one day there turned up a stranger belonging
to a hostile tribe who occupied another part
of the island:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“The stranger could not have been more than
twenty-five years of age, and was a little
above the ordinary height; had he been a single
hair’s breadth taller, the matchless symmetry of
his form would have been destroyed. His unclad
limbs were beautifully formed; whilst the elegant
outline of his figure, together with his beardless
cheeks, might have entitled him to the distinction
of standing for the statue of the Polynesian
Apollo; and indeed the oval of his countenance
and the regularity of every feature reminded me
of an antique bust. But the marble repose of art
was supplied by a warmth and liveliness of expression
only to be seen in the South Sea Islander<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
under the most favourable developments of
nature.... When I expressed my surprise (at his
venturing among the Typees) he looked at me for
a moment as if enjoying my perplexity, and then
with his strange vivacity exclaimed—‘Ah! me
taboo—me go Nukuheva—me go Tior—me go
Typee—me go everywhere—nobody harm me,
me taboo.’</p>

<p>“This explanation would have been altogether
unintelligible to me, had it not recalled to my mind
something I had previously heard concerning a
singular custom among these islanders. Though
the country is possessed by various tribes, whose
mutual hostilities almost wholly preclude any
intercourse between them; yet there are instances
where a person having ratified friendly relations
with some individual belonging to the valley,
whose inmates are at war with his own, may under
particular restrictions venture with impunity into
the country of his friend, where under other circumstances
he would have been treated as an
enemy. In this light are personal friendships regarded
among them, and the individual so protected
is said to be ‘taboo,’ and his person to a
certain extent is held as sacred. Thus the stranger
informed me he had access to all the valleys in
the island.” <i>Typee</i>, <i>Herman Melville</i>, ch. xviii.</p>

<p class="dropcap-pic">In almost all primitive nations, warfare
has given rise to institutions of military
comradeship—including, for instance,
institutions of instruction for
young warriors, of personal devotion to their
leaders, or of personal attachment to each other.
In Greece these customs were specially defined, as
later quotations will show.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Tacitus on Military Comradeship</i></div>

<p>Tacitus, speaking of the arrangement among the
Germans by which each military chief was surrounded
by younger companions in arms, says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“There is great emulation among the companions,
which shall possess the highest place
in the favour of their chief; and among the chiefs,
which shall excel in the number and valour of his
companions. It is their dignity, their strength,
to be always surrounded with a large body of
select youth, an ornament in peace, a bulwark in
war... In the field of battle, it is disgraceful for
the chief to be surpassed in valour; it is disgraceful
for the companions not to equal their chief;
but it is reproach and infamy during a whole succeeding
life to retreat from the field surviving
him. To aid, to protect him; to place their own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
gallant actions to the account of his glory is their
first and most sacred engagement.” <i>Tacitus</i>, <i>Germania</i>,

<p class="dropcap-pic">Among the Arab tribes very much
the same thing may be found, every
Sheikh having his bodyguard of
young men, whom he instructs and
educates, while they render to him their military and
personal devotion. In the late expedition of the
British to Khartoum (Nov., 1899), when Colonel
Wingate and his troops mowed down the Khalifa
and his followers with their Maxims, the death of
the Khalifa was thus described by a correspondent
of the daily papers:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“In the centre of what was evidently the main
attack on our right we came across a very large
number of bodies all huddled together in a very
small place; their horses lay dead behind them, the
Khalifa lay dead on his furma, or sheepskin, the
typical end of the Arab Sheikh who disdains surrender;
on his right was the Khalifa Aly Wad Hila,
and on his left Ahmed Fedil, his great fighting
leader, whilst all around him lay his faithful emirs,
all content to meet their death when he had chosen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
to meet his. His black Mulamirin, or bodyguard,
all lay dead in a straight line about 40 yards in front
of their master’s body, with their faces to the foe
and faithful to the last. It was truly a touching
sight, and one could not help but feel that ... their
end was truly grand.... Amongst the dead were
found two men tied together by the arms, who had
charged towards the guns and had got nearer than
any others. On enquiring of the prisoners Colonel
Wingate was told these two were great friends, and
on seeing the Egyptian guns come up had tied
themselves by the arms with a cord, swearing to
reach the guns or die together.”</p>

their parents about the age of puberty and live with
such men as Monina for the sake of instruction.
When I asked the nature of the instruction I was
told ‘Bonyái,’ which I suppose may be understood
as indicating manhood, for it sounds as if we should
say, ‘to teach an American Americanism,’ or, ‘an
Englishman to be English.’ While here they are

<p class="dropcap-pic">With regard to Greece, J. Addington
Symonds has some interesting remarks,
which are well worthy of
consideration; he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Nearly all the historians of Greece have
failed to insist upon the fact that fraternity in
arms played for the Greek race the same part as the
idealisation of women for the knighthood of feudal
Europe. Greek mythology and history are full of
tales of friendship, which can only be paralleled by
the story of David and Jonathan in the Bible. The
legends of Herakles and Hylas, of Theseus and
Pirithöus, of Apollo and Hyacinth, of Orestes and
Pylades, occur immediately to the mind. Among
the noblest patriots, tyrannicides, lawgivers, and
self-devoted heroes in the early times of Greece,
we always find the names of friends and comrades
received with peculiar honour. Harmodius and
Aristogeiton, who slew the despot Hipparchus at
Athens; Diocles and Philolaus, who gave laws to
Thebes; Chariton and Melanippus, who resisted
the sway of Phalaris in Sicily; Cratinus and Aristodemus,
who devoted their lives to propitiate offended
deities when a plague had fallen on Athens;
these comrades, staunch to each other in their love,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
and elevated by friendship to the pitch of noblest
enthusiasm, were among the favourite saints of
Greek legend and history. In a word, the chivalry
of Hellas found its motive force in friendship rather
than in the love of women; and the motive force of
all chivalry is a generous, soul-exalting, unselfish
passion. The fruit which friendship bore among
the Greeks was courage in the face of danger, indifference
to life when honour was at stake, patriotic
ardour, the love of liberty, and lion-hearted
rivalry in battle. ‘Tyrants,’ said Plato, ‘stand in
awe of friends.’” <i>Studies of the Greek Poets.</i> <i>By J. A.
Symonds</i>, vol. 1, p. 97.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">The customs connected with this fraternity
in arms, in Sparta and in
Crete, are described with care and at
considerable length in the following
extract from Müller’s <i>History and Antiquities of the
Doric Race</i>, book iv., ch. 4, par. 6:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“At Sparta the party loving was called εἰσπνήλας,
and his affection was termed a <i>breathing in</i>, or
<i>inspiring</i> (εἰσπνεῖν); which expresses the pure and
mental connection between the two persons, and
corresponds with the name of the other, viz.: ἀίτας,
<i>i.e.</i>, <i>listener</i> or <i>bearer</i>. Now it appears to have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
the practice for every youth of good character to
have his lover; and on the other hand every well-educated
man was bound by custom to be the lover
of some youth. Instances of this connection are
furnished by several of the royal family of Sparta;
thus, Agesilaus, while he still belonged to the herd
(ἀγέλη) of youths, was the hearer (ἀίτας) of Lysander,
and himself had in his turn also a hearer; his
son Archidamus was the lover of the son of Sphodrias,
the noble Cleonymus; Cleomenes III. was
when a young man the hearer of Xenares, and later
in life the lover of the brave Panteus. The connection
usually originated from the proposal of the
lover; yet it was necessary that the listener should
accept him with real affection, as a regard to the
riches of the proposer was considered very disgraceful;
sometimes, however, it happened that
the proposal originated from the other party. The
connection appears to have been very intimate and
faithful; and was recognised by the State. If his
relations were absent, the youth might be represented
in the public assembly by his lover; in battle
too they stood near one another, where their fidelity
and affection were often shown till death; while
at home the youth was constantly under the eyes
of his lover, who was to him as it were a model and
pattern of life; which explains why, for many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
faults, particularly want of ambition, the lover
could be punished instead of the listener.”</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Crete</i></div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“This ancient national custom prevailed with
still greater force in Crete; which island was
hence by many persons considered as the original
seat of the connection in question. Here too it was
disgraceful for a well-educated youth to be without
a lover; and hence the party loved was termed
κλεινὸς, the <i>praised</i>; the lover being simply called
φιλήτωρ. It appears that the youth was always
carried away by force, the intention of the ravisher
being previously communicated to the relations,
who however took no measures of precaution, and
only made a feigned resistance; except when the
ravisher appeared, either in family or talent,
unworthy of the youth. The lover then led him away
to his apartment (ἀνδρεῖον), and afterwards, with
any chance companions, either to the mountains
or to his estate. Here they remained two months
(the period prescribed by custom), which were
passed chiefly in hunting together. After this time
had expired, the lover dismissed the youth, and at
his departure gave him, according to custom, an
ox, a military dress, and brazen cup, with other
things; and frequently these gifts were increased
by the friends of the ravisher. The youth then
sacrificed the ox to Jupiter, with which he gave a feast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
to his companions: and now he stated how he had
been pleased with his lover; and he had complete
liberty by law to punish any insult or disgraceful
treatment. It depended now on the choice of the
youth whether the connection should be broken
off or not. If it was kept up, the companion in arms
(παραστάτης), as the youth was then called, wore
the military dress which had been given him, and
fought in battle next his lover, inspired with double
valour by the gods of war and love, according to
the notions of the Cretans; and even in man’s age
he was distinguished by the first place and rank in
the course, and certain insignia worn about the
body.</p>

<p>“Institutions, so systematic and regular as these,
did not exist in any Doric State except Crete and
Sparta; but the feelings on which they were founded
seem to have been common to all the Dorians.
The loves of Philolaus, a Corinthian of the family
of the Bacchiadae, and the lawgiver of Thebes, and
of Diocles the Olympic conqueror, lasted until
death; and even their graves were turned towards
one another in token of their affection; and another
person of the same name was honoured in
Megara, as a noble instance of self-devotion for the
object of his love.” <i>Ibid.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Diocles</i></div>

<p>For an account of Philolaus and Diocles, Aristotle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>

Diocles was an Athenian who died in battle for the

<p class="dropcap-pic">Hahn, in his <i>Albanesische Studien</i>, says
that the Dorian customs of comradeship
still flourish in Albania “just as
described by the ancients,” and are
closely entwined with the whole life of the people—though
he says nothing of any military signification.
It appears to be a quite recognised institution
for a young man to take to himself a youth or boy as
his special comrade. He instructs, and when necessary
reproves, the younger; protects him, and
makes him presents of various kinds. The relation
generally, though not always ends with the marriage
of the elder. The following is reported by
Hahn as in the actual words of his informant (an
Albanian):—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Love of this kind is occasioned by the sight
of a beautiful youth; who thus kindles in
the lover a feeling of wonder and causes his heart
to open to the sweet sense which springs from the
contemplation of beauty. By degrees love steals
in and takes possession of the lover, and to such
a degree that all his thoughts and feelings are absorbed
in it. When near the beloved he loses himself
in the sight of him; when absent he thinks of
him only.” These loves, he continued, “are with a
few exceptions as pure as sunshine, and the highest
and noblest affections that the human heart can
entertain.” <i>Hahn</i>, vol. 1, p. 166.</p>

</div>

<p>Hahn also mentions that troops of youths, like
the Cretan and Spartan <i>agelae</i>, are formed in Albania,
of twenty-five or thirty members each. The
comradeship usually begins during adolescence,
each member paying a fixed sum into a common
fund, and the interest being spent on two or three
annual feasts, generally held out of doors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Theban Band</i></div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">The Sacred Band of Thebes, or Theban
Band, was a battalion composed
entirely of friends and lovers; and
forms a remarkable example of military<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
comradeship. The references to it in later
Greek literature are very numerous, and there
seems no reason to doubt the general truth of the
traditions concerning its formation and its complete
annihilation by Philip of Macedon at the battle of
Chaeronea (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 338). Thebes was the last stronghold
of Hellenic independence, and with the Theban
Band Greek freedom perished. But the mere
existence of this phalanx, and the fact of its renown,
show to what an extent comradeship was recognised
and prized as an <i>institution</i> among these peoples.
The following account is taken from Plutarch’s <i>Life
of Pelopidas</i>, Clough’s translation:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Gorgidas, according to some, first formed
the Sacred Band of 300 chosen men, to whom
as being a guard for the citadel the State allowed
provision, and all things necessary for exercise;
and hence they were called the city band, as citadels
of old were usually called cities. Others say
that it was composed of young men attached to
each other by personal affection, and a pleasant
saying of Pammenes is current, that Homer’s
Nestor was not well skilled in ordering an army,
when he advised the Greeks to rank tribe and tribe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
and family and family, together, that so ‘tribe
might tribe, and kinsmen kinsmen aid,’ but that
he should have joined lovers and their beloved.
For men of the same tribe or family little value one
another when dangers press; but a band cemented
together by friendship grounded upon love is
never to be broken, and invincible; since the lovers,
ashamed to be base in sight of their beloved,
and the beloved before their lovers, willingly rush
into danger for the relief of one another. Nor can
that be wondered at since they have more regard
for their absent lovers than for others present; as
in the instance of the man who, when his enemy
was going to kill him, earnestly requested him to
run him through the breast, that his lover might
not blush to see him wounded in the back. It is a
tradition likewise that Ioläus, who assisted Hercules
in his labours and fought at his side, was beloved
of him; and Aristotle observes that even in
his time lovers plighted their faith at Ioläus’ tomb.
It is likely, therefore, that this band was called sacred
on this account; as Plato calls a lover a divine
friend. It is stated that it was never beaten till the
battle at Chaeronea; and when Philip after the
fight took a view of the slain, and came to the place
where the three hundred that fought his phalanx
lay dead together, he wondered, and understanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
that it was the band of lovers, he shed tears and
said, ‘Perish any man who suspects that these men
either did or suffered anything that was base.’</p>

<p>“It was not the disaster of Laius, as the poets imagine,
that first gave rise to this form of attachment
among the Thebans, but their lawgivers, designing
to soften whilst they were young their natural
fickleness, brought for example the pipe into great
esteem, both in serious and sportive occasions, and
gave great encouragement to these friendships in
the Palaestra, to temper the manner and character
of the youth. With a view to this, they did well
again to make Harmony, the daughter of Mars
and Venus, their tutelar deity; since where force
and courage is joined with gracefulness and winning
behaviour, a harmony ensues that combines
all the elements of society in perfect consonance
and order.</p>

<p>“Gorgidas distributed this sacred Band all
through the front ranks of the infantry, and thus
made their gallantry less conspicuous; not being
united in one body, but mingled with many others
of inferior resolution, they had no fair opportunity
of showing what they could do. But Pelopidas,
having sufficiently tried their bravery at Tegyrae,
where they had fought alone, and around his own
person, never afterwards divided them, but keeping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
them entire, and as one man, gave them the
first duty in the greatest battles. For as horses run
brisker in a chariot than single, not that their joint
force divides the air with greater ease, but because
being matched one against another circulation kindles
and enflames their courage; thus, he thought,
brave men, provoking one another to noble actions,
would prove most serviceable and most resolute
where all were united together.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Stories of romantic friendship form
a staple subject of Greek literature,
and were everywhere accepted and
prized. The following quotations
from Athenæus and Plutarch contain allusions to
the Theban Band, and other examples:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“And the Lacedæmonians offer sacrifices to
Love before they go to battle, thinking that
safety and victory depend on the friendship of
those who stand side by side in the battle array....
And the regiment among the Thebans, which
is called the <i>Sacred Band</i>, is wholly composed of
mutual lovers, indicating the majesty of the God,
as these men prefer a glorious death to a shameful
and discreditable life.” <i>Athenæus</i>, bk. xiii., ch. 12.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ioläus</i></div>

<p>Ioläus, above-mentioned, is said to have been the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
charioteer of Hercules, and his faithful companion.
As the comrade of Hercules he was worshipped beside
him in Thebes, where the gymnasium was
named after him. Plutarch alludes to this friendship
again in his treatise on Love (<i>Eroticus</i>, par.
17):—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“And as to the loves of Hercules, it is difficult
to record them because of their number; but
those who think that Ioläus was one of them do to
this day worship and honour him, and make their
loved ones swear fidelity at his tomb.”</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Plutarch on Love</i></div>

<p>And in the same treatise:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Consider also how Love (Eros) excels in
warlike feats, and is by no means idle, as Euripides
called him, nor a carpet knight, nor ‘sleeping
on soft maidens’ cheeks.’ For a man inspired
by Love needs not Ares to help him when he goes
out as a warrior against the enemy, but at the bidding
of his own god is ‘ready’ for his friend ‘to go
through fire and water and whirlwinds.’ And in
Sophocles’ play, when the sons of Niobe are being
shot at and dying, one of them calls out for no
helper or assister but his lover.</p>

<p>“And you know of course how it was that Cleomachus,
the Pharsalian, fell in battle.... When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
the war between the Eretrians and Chalcidians was
at its height, Cleomachus had come to aid the
latter with a Thessalian force; and the Chalcidian
infantry seemed strong enough, but they had great
difficulty in repelling the enemy’s cavalry. So they
begged that high-souled hero, Cleomachus, to
charge the Eretrian cavalry first. And he asked the
youth he loved, who was by, if he would be a spectator
of the fight, and he saying he would, and
affectionately kissing him and putting his helmet
on his head, Cleomachus, with a proud joy, put
himself at the head of the bravest of the Thessalians,
and charged the enemy’s cavalry with such
impetuosity that he threw them into disorder and
routed them; and the Eretrian infantry also fleeing
in consequence, the Chalcidians won a splendid
victory. However, Cleomachus got killed, and
they show his tomb in the market place at Chalcis,
over which a huge pillar stands to this day.” <i>Eroticus</i>,
par. 17, <i>trans. Bohn’s Classics</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>And further on in the same:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“And among you Thebans, Pemptides, is it not
usual for the lover to give his boylove a complete
suit of armour when he is enrolled among the
men? And did not the erotic Pammenes change
the disposition of the heavy-armed infantry, censuring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
Homer as knowing nothing about love,
because he drew up the Achæans in order of battle
in tribes and clans, and did not put lover and love
together, that so ‘spear should be next to spear and
helmet to helmet’ (<i>Iliad</i>, xiii. 131), seeing that
love is the only invincible general. For men in
battle will leave in the lurch clansmen and friends,
aye, and parents and sons, but what warrior ever
broke through or charged through lover and love,
seeing that when there is no necessity lovers
frequently display their bravery and contempt
of life.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“But Hieronymus the Peripatetic
says that the loves of youths
used to be much encouraged, for
this reason, that the vigour of the young and their
close agreement in comradeship have led to the
overthrow of many a tyranny. For in the presence
of his favorite a lover would rather endure anything
than earn the name of coward; a thing which
was proved in practice by the Sacred Band, established
at Thebes under Epaminondas; as well as
by the death of the Pisistratidæ, which was brought
about by Harmodius and Aristogeiton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>“And at Agrigentum in Sicily the same was
shown by the mutual love of Chariton and Melanippus—of
whom Melanippus was the younger
beloved, as Heraclides of Pontus tells in his Treatise
on Love. For these two having been accused
of plotting against Phalaris, and being put to torture
in order to force them to betray their accomplices,
not only did not tell, but even compelled
Phalaris to such pity of their tortures that he released
them with many words of praise. Whereupon
Apollo, pleased at his conduct, granted to
Phalaris a respite from death; and declared the
same to the men who inquired of the Pythian
priestess how they might best attack him. He also
gave an oracular saying concerning Chariton....</p>

<p class="dropcap-pic">These are mainly instances of what
might be called “military comradeship,”
but as may be supposed,
friendship in the early world did not
rest on this alone. With the growth of culture
other interests came in; and among the Greeks especially
association in the pursuit of art or politics
or philosophy became a common ground. Parmenides,
the philosopher, whose life was held peculiarly
holy, loved his pupil Zeno (see Plato <i>Parm</i>, 127A):</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Parmenides and Zeno came to Athens, he
said, at the great Panathenæan festival; the
former was, at the time of his visit, about 65 years
old, very white with age, but well-favoured. Zeno
was nearly 40 years of age, of a noble figure and
fair aspect; and in the days of his youth he was reported
to have been beloved of Parmenides.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Phædo</i></div>

<p>Pheidias, the sculptor, loved Pantarkes, a youth
of Elis, and carved his portrait at the foot of the
Olympian Zeus (Pausanias v. II), and politicians
and orators like Demosthenes and Æschines were
proud to avow their attachments. It was in a house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
of ill-fame, according to Diogenes Laertius (ii. 105)
that Socrates first met Phædo:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“This unfortunate youth was a native of Elis.
Taken prisoner in war, he was sold in the
public market to a slave dealer, who then acquired
the right by Attic law to engross his earnings for
his own pocket. A friend of Socrates, perhaps
Cebes, bought him from his master, and he became
one of the chief members of the Socratic circle. His
name is given to the Platonic dialogue on immortality,
and he lived to found what is called the
Eleo-Socratic School. No reader of Plato forgets
how the sage on the eve of his death stroked the
beautiful long hair of Phædo, and prophesied that
he would soon have to cut it short in mourning for
his teacher.” <i>J. A. Symonds</i>, <i>A Problem in Greek
Ethics</i> p. 58.</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">I conclude the present section by
the insertion of three stories taken
from classical sources. Though of
a legendary character, it is probable
that they enshrine some memory or tradition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
actual facts. The story of Harmodius and Aristogeiton
at any rate is treated by Herodotus and
Thucydides as a matter of serious history. The
names of these two friends were ever on the lips of
the Athenians as the founders of the city’s freedom,
and to be born of their blood was esteemed among
the highest of honours. But whether historical or
not, these stories have much the same value for us,
in so far as they indicate the ideals on which the
Greek mind dwelt, and which it considered possible
of realisation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Now the attempt of Aristogeiton and Harmodius
arose out of a love affair, which I will
narrate at length; and the narrative will show that
the Athenians themselves give quite an inaccurate
account of their own tyrants, and of the incident
in question, and know no more than other Hellenes.
Pisistratus died at an advanced age in possession
of the tyranny, and then, not as is the
common opinion Hipparchus, but Hippias (who
was the eldest of his sons) succeeded to his power.</p>

<p>“Harmodius was in the flower of his youth, and
Aristogeiton, a citizen of the middle class, became
his lover. Hipparchus made an attempt to gain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
the affections of Harmodius, but he would not
listen to him, and told Aristogeiton. The latter was
naturally tormented at the idea, and fearing that
Hipparchus, who was powerful, would resort to
violence, at once formed such a plot as a man in
his station might for the overthrow of the tyranny.
Meanwhile Hipparchus made another attempt;
he had no better success, and thereupon he determined,
not indeed to take any violent step, but to
insult Harmodius in some underhand manner, so
that his motive could not be suspected<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>....</p>

<p>“When Hipparchus found his advances repelled
by Harmodius he carried out his intention of insulting
him. There was a young sister of his whom
Hipparchus and his friends first invited to come
and carry a sacred basket in a procession, and then
rejected her, declaring that she had never been invited
by them at all because she was unworthy.
At this Harmodius was very angry, and Aristogeiton
for his sake more angry still. They and the
other conspirators had already laid their preparations,
but were waiting for the festival of the great
Panathenæa, when the citizens who took part in
the procession assembled in arms; for to wear
arms on any other day would have aroused suspicion.
Harmodius and Aristogeiton were to begin
the attack, and the rest were immediately to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
join in, and engage with the guards. The plot had
been communicated to a few only, the better to
avoid detection; but they hoped that, however few
struck the blow, the crowd who would be armed,
although not in the secret, would at once rise and
assist in the recovery of their own liberties.</p>

<p>“The day of the festival arrived, and Hippias
went out of the city to the place called the Ceramicus,
where he was occupied with his guards in
marshalling the procession. Harmodius and
Aristogeiton, who were ready with their daggers,
stepped forward to do the deed. But seeing one
of the conspirators in familiar conversation with
Hippias, who was readily accessible to all, they
took alarm and imagined that they had been betrayed,
and were on the point or being seized.
Whereupon they determined to take their revenge
first on the man who had outraged them and was
the cause of their desperate attempt. So they
rushed, just as they were, within the gates. They
found Hipparchus near the Leocorium, as it was
called, and then and there falling upon him with
all the blind fury, one of an injured lover, the other
of a man smarting under an insult, they smote and
slew him. The crowd ran together, and so Aristogeiton
for the present escaped the guards; but he
was afterwards taken, and not very gently handled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
(<i>i.e.</i>, <i>tortured</i>). Harmodius perished on the spot.”

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Story of Orestes and Pylades</i></div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Phocis preserves from early times the memory
of the union between Orestes and Pylades,
who taking a god as witness of the passion between
them, sailed through life together as though in one
boat. Both together put to death Klytemnestra, as
though both were sons of Agamemnon; and Ægisthus
was slain by both. Pylades suffered more than
his friend by the punishment which pursued Orestes.
He stood by him when condemned, nor did
they limit their tender friendship by the bounds of
Greece, but sailed to the furthest boundaries of the
Scythians—the one sick, the other ministering to
him. When they had come into the Tauric land
straightway they were met by the matricidal fury;
and while the barbarians were standing round in a
circle Orestes fell down and lay on the ground,
seized by his usual mania, while Pylades ‘wiped
away the foam, tended his body, and covered him
with his well-woven cloak’—acting not only like a
lover but like a father.</p>

<p>“When it was determined that one should remain
to be put to death, and the other should go to Mycenæ
to convey a letter, each wishes to remain for
the sake of the other, thinking that if he saves the
life of his friend he saves his own life. Orestes refused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
to take the letter, saying that Pylades was
more worthy to carry it, acting more like the lover
than the beloved. ‘For,’ he said, ‘the slaying of this
man would be a great grief to me, as I am the cause
of these misfortunes.’ And he added, ‘Give the
tablet to him, for (turning to Pylades) I will send
thee to Argos, in order that it may be well with
thee; as for me, let anyone kill me who desires it.’</p>

<p>“Such love is always like that; for when from boyhood
a serious love has grown up and it becomes
adult at the age of reason, the long-loved object returns
reciprocal affection, and it is hard to determine
which is the lover of which, for—as from a
mirror—the affection of the lover is reflected from
the beloved.” <i>Trans. from Lucian’s Amores, by W.
J. Baylis.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Story of Damon and Pythias (or Phintias)</i></div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Damon and Phintias, initiates in the Pythagorean
mysteries, contracted so faithful a
friendship towards each other, that when Dionysius
of Syracuse intended to execute one of them, and
he had obtained permission from the tyrant to return
home and arrange his affairs before his death,
the other did not hesitate to give himself up as a
pledge of his friend’s return<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. He whose neck had
been in danger was now free; and he who might
have lived in safety was now in danger of death. So
everybody, and especially Dionysius, were wondering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
what would be the upshot of this novel and
dubious affair. At last, when the day fixed was close
at hand, and he had not returned, everyone condemned
the one who stood security, for his stupidity
and rashness. But he insisted that he had nothing
to fear in the matter of his friend’s constancy.
And indeed at the same moment and the hour fixed
by Dionysius, he who had received leave, returned.
The tyrant, admiring the courage of both, remitted
the sentence which had so tried their loyalty, and
asked them besides to receive him in the bonds of
their friendship, saying that he would make his
third place in their affection agreeable by his utmost
goodwill and effort. Such indeed are the powers of
friendship: to breed contempt of death, to overcome
the sweet desire of life, to humanise cruelty, to turn
hate into love, to compensate punishment by largess;
to which powers almost as much veneration
is due as to the cult of the immortal gods. For if
with these rests the public safety, on those does private
happiness depend; and as the temples are the
sacred domiciles of these, so of those are the loyal
hearts of men as it were the shrines consecrated by
some holy spirit.” <i>Valerius Maximus</i>, bk. iv. ch. 7.

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">The extent to which the idea of friendship
(in a quite romantic sense) penetrated
the Greek mind is a thing very
difficult for us to realise; and some
modern critics entirely miss this point. They laud
the Greek culture to the skies, extolling the warlike
bravery of the people, their enthusiastic political and
social sentiment, their wonderful artistic sense, and
so forth; and at the same time speak of the stress
they laid on friendship as a little peculiarity of no
particular importance—not seeing that the latter was
the chief source of their bravery and independence,
one of the main motives of their art, and so far an organic
part of their whole polity that it is difficult to
imagine the one without the other. The Greeks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
themselves never made this mistake; and their literature
abounds with references to the romantic attachment
as the great inspiration of political and individual
life. Plato, himself, may almost be said to have
founded his philosophy on this sentiment.</p>

<p>Nothing is more surprising to the modern than
to find Plato speaking, page after page, of Love, as
the safeguard of states and the tutoress of philosophy,
and then to discover that what we call love, <i>i.e.</i>,
the love between man and woman, is not meant at all—scarcely
comes within his consideration—but only
the love between men—what we should call romantic
friendship. His ideal of this latter love is ascetic;
it is an absorbing passion, but it is held in strong control.
The other love—the love of women—is for
him a mere sensuality. In this, to some extent, lies
the explanation of his philosophical position.</p>

<p>But it is evident that in this fact—in the fact that
among the Greeks the love of women was considered
for the most part sensual, while the <i>romance</i> of love
went to the account of friendship, we have the
strength and the weakness of the Greek civilisation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Strength, because by the recognition everywhere of
romantic comradeship, public and private life was
filled by a kind of divine fire; weakness, because by
the non-recognition of woman’s equal part in such
comradeship, her saving, healing, and redeeming influence
was lost, and the Greek culture doomed to be
to that extent one-sided. It will, we may hope, be
the great triumph of the modern love (when it becomes
more of a true comradeship between man and
woman than it yet is) to give both to society and to
the individual the grandest inspirations, and perhaps
in conjunction with the other attachment, to lift the
modern nations to a higher level of political and artistic
advancement than even the Greeks attained.
I quote one or two modern writers on the subject,
and then some passages from Plato and others indicating
the philosophy of friendship as entertained
among the Greeks.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Bishop Thirlwall, that excellent
thinker and scholar, in his <i>History
of Greece</i> (vol. 1, p. 176) says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“One of the noblest and most amiable
sides of the Greek character
is the readiness with which it lent itself to construct
intimate and durable friendships; and this is
a feature no less prominent in the earliest than in
the latest times. It was indeed connected with the
comparatively low estimation in which female society
was held; but the devotedness and constancy
with which these attachments were maintained was
not the less admirable and engaging. The heroic
companions whom we find celebrated, partly by
Homer and partly in traditions, which if not of
equal antiquity were grounded on the same feeling,
seem to have but one heart and soul, with scarcely
a wish or object apart, and only to live, as they are
always ready to die, for one another. It is true that
the relation between them is not always one of
perfect equality: but this is a circumstance which,
while it often adds a peculiar charm to the poetical
description, detracts little from the dignity of the
idea which it presents. Such were the friendships of
Hercules and Ioläus, of Theseus and Pirithöus, of
Orestes and Pylades: and though these may owe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
the greater part of their fame to the later epic or
even dramatic poetry, the moral groundwork undoubtedly
subsisted in the period to which the tradition
referred. The argument of the Iliad mainly
turns on the affection of Achilles for Patroclus—whose
love for the greater hero is only tempered by
reverence for his higher birth and his unequalled
prowess. But the mutual regard which united
Idomeneus and Meriones, Diomedes and Sthenelus—though,
as the persons themselves are less important,
it is kept more in the background—is
manifestly viewed by the poet in the same light.
The idea of a Greek hero seems not to have been
thought complete, without such a brother in arms
by his side.”</p>

<p>The following is from Ludwig Frey (<i>Der Eros und

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap-pic">G. Lowes Dickinson, in his <i>Greek
View of Life</i>, noting the absence of romance
in the relations between men
and women of that civilisation, says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to
conclude, from these conditions, that the element
of romance was absent from Greek life. The
fact is simply that with them it took a different
form, that of passionate friendship between men.
Such friendships, of course, occur in all nations and
at all times, but among the Greeks they were, we
might say, an institution. Their ideal was the development
and education of the younger by the
older man, and in this view they were recognised
and approved by custom and law as an important
factor in the state.” <i>Greek View of Life</i>, p. 167.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“So much indeed were the Greeks impressed with
the manliness of this passion, with its power to
prompt to high thought and heroic action, that
some of the best of them set the love of man for
man far above that of man for woman. The one,
they maintained, was primarily of the spirit, the
other primarily of the flesh; the one bent upon shaping
to the type of all manly excellence both the
body and the soul of the beloved, the other upon a
passing pleasure of the senses.” <i>Ibid</i>, p. 172.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Relation to Women</i></div>

<p>The following are some remarks of J. A. Symonds
on the same subject:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Partly owing to the social habits of their
cities, and partly to the peculiar notions which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
they entertained regarding the seclusion of free
women in the home, all the higher elements of
spiritual and mental activity, and the conditions
under which a generous passion was conceivable,
had become the exclusive privileges of men. It was
not that women occupied a semi-servile station, as
some students have imagined, or that within the
sphere of the household they were not the respected
and trusted helpmates of men. But circumstances
rendered it impossible for them to excite
romantic and enthusiastic passion. The exaltation
of the emotions was reserved for the male sex.”
<i>A Problem in Greek Ethics</i>, p. 68.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>J. A. Symonds on Socrates</i></div>

<p>And he continues:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Socrates therefore sought to direct and
moralise a force already existing. In the <i>Phædrus</i>
he describes the passion of love between man and
boy as a ‘<i>mania</i>,’ not different in quality from that
which inspires poets; and after painting that fervid
picture of the lover, he declares that the true object
of a noble life can only be attained by passionate
friends, bound together in the chains of close yet
temperate comradeship, seeking always to advance
in knowledge, self-restraint, and intellectual illumination.
The doctrine of the <i>Symposium</i> is not different,
except that Socrates here takes a higher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
flight. The same love is treated as the method
whereby the soul may begin her mystic journey to
the region of essential beauty, truth, and goodness.
It has frequently been remarked that Plato’s dialogues
have to be read as poems even more than as
philosophical treatises; and if this be true at all, it is
particularly true of both the <i>Phædrus</i> and the <i>Symposium</i>.
The lesson which both essays seem intended
to inculcate, is this: love, like poetry and prophecy,
is a divine gift, which diverts men from the
common current of their lives; but in the right use
of this gift lies the secret of all human excellence.
The passion which grovels in the filth of sensual
grossness may be transformed into a glorious enthusiasm,
a winged splendour, capable of soaring
to the contemplation of eternal verities.”</p>

<p class="dropcap-pic">In the <i>Symposium</i> or <i>Banquet</i> of Plato
(<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 428—<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 347), a supper party is
supposed, at which a discussion on
love and friendship takes place. The
friends present speak in turn—the enthusiastic
Phædrus, the clear-headed Pausanias, the grave doctor
Eryximachus, the comic and acute Aristophanes,
the young poet Agathon; Socrates, tantalising, suggestive,
and quoting the profound sayings of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
prophetess Diotima; and Alcibiades, drunk, and
quite ready to drink more;—each in his turn, out
of the fulness of his heart, speaks; and thus in this
most dramatic dialogue we have love discussed from
every point of view, and with insight, acumen, romance
and humour unrivalled.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>From the Speech of Phædrus in the Symposium</i></div>

<p>Phædrus and Pausanias, in the two following
quotations, take the line which perhaps most thoroughly
represents the public opinion of the day—as
to the value of friendship in nurturing a spirit of
honour and freedom, especially in matters military
and political:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Thus numerous are the witnesses who acknowledge
love to be the eldest of the gods.
And not only is he the eldest, he is also the source
of the greatest benefits to us. For I know not any
greater blessing to a young man beginning life
than a virtuous lover, or to the lover than a beloved
youth. For the principle which ought to be
the guide of men who would nobly live—that principle,
I say, neither kindred, nor honour, nor
wealth, nor any other motive is able to implant so
well as love. Of what am I speaking? of the sense
of honour and dishonour, without which neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
states nor individuals ever do any good or great
work. And I say that a lover who is detected in doing
any dishonorable act, or submitting through
cowardice when any dishonour is done to him by
another, will be more pained at being detected by
his beloved than at being seen by his father, or
by his companions, or by anyone else. The beloved
too, when he is seen in any disgraceful situation,
has the same feeling about his lover. And if there
were only some way of contriving that a state or an
army should be made up of lovers and their loves,
they would be the very best governors of their own
city, abstaining from all dishonour, and emulating
one another in honour; and when fighting at one
another’s side, although a mere handful, they
would overcome the world. For what lover would
not choose rather to be seen by all mankind than
by his beloved, either when abandoning his post or
throwing away his arms? He would be ready to die
a thousand deaths rather than endure this. Or who
would desert his beloved, or fail him in the hour of
danger? The veriest coward would become an inspired
hero, equal to the bravest, at such a time;
love would inspire him. That courage which, as
Homer says, the god breathes into the soul of
heroes, love of his own nature infuses into the
lover.” <i>Symposium of Plato</i>, <i>trans. B. Jowett</i>.</p>

<p class="dropcap">“And these when they grow up are our statesmen,
and these only, which is a great proof of
the truth of what I am saying. And when they reach
manhood they are lovers of youth, and are not
naturally inclined to marry or beget children, which
they do, if at all, only in obedience to the law, but
they are satisfied if they may be allowed to live with
one another unwedded; and such a nature is prone
to love and ready to return love, always embracing
that which is akin to him. And when one of them
finds his other half, whether he be a lover of youth
or a lover of another sort, the pair are lost in an
amazement of love and friendship and intimacy,
and one will not be out of the other’s sight, as I may
say, even for a moment: they will pass their whole
lives together; yet they could not explain what
they desire of one another. For the intense yearning
that each of them has towards the other does
not appear to be the desire of lovers’ intercourse,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
but of something else which the soul of either evidently
desires and cannot tell, and of which she
only has a dark and doubtful presentiment. Suppose
Hephæstus, with his instruments, to come to
the pair who are lying side by side and say to them,
‘What do you people want of one another?’ they
would be unable to explain. And suppose further
that when he saw their perplexity he said: ‘Do you
desire to be wholly one; always day and night to be
in one another’s company? for if this is what you
desire, I am ready to melt you into one and let you
grow together, so that being two you shall become
one, and while you live, live a common life as if
you were a single man, and after your death in the
world below still be one departed soul instead of
two—I ask whether this is what you lovingly desire,
and whether you are satisfied to attain this?’—there
is not a man of them who when he heard the
proposal would deny or would not acknowledge
that this meeting and melting in one another’s
arms, this becoming one instead of two, was the
very expression of his ancient need.” <i>Ibid.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Socrates, in his speech, and especially
in the later portion of it where
he quotes his supposed tutoress Diotima,
carries the argument up to its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
highest issue. After contending for the essentially
creative, generative nature of love, not only in the
Body but in the Soul, he proceeds to say that it is not
so much the seeking of a lost half which causes the
creative impulse in lovers, as the fact that in our
mortal friends we are contemplating (though unconsciously)
an image of the Essential and Divine
Beauty; it is this that affects us with that wonderful
“mania,” and lifts us into the region where we become
creators. And he follows on to the conclusion
that it is by wisely and truly loving our visible
friends that at last, after long long experience, there
dawns upon us the vision of that Absolute Beauty
which by mortal eyes must ever remain unseen:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“He who has been instructed thus far in the
things of love, and who has learned to see
the beautiful in due order and succession, when he
comes towards the end will suddenly perceive a
nature of wondrous beauty ... beauty absolute,
separate, simple and everlasting, which without
diminution and without increase, or any change, is
imparted to the evergrowing and perishing beauties
of all other things. He who, from these ascending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
under the influence of true love, begins to
perceive that beauty, is not far from the end.” <i>Ibid.</i></p>

</div>

<p>This is indeed the culmination, for Plato, of all
existence—the ascent into the presence of that endless
Beauty of which all fair mortal things are but the
mirrors. But to condense this great speech of Socrates
is impossible; only to persistent and careful
reading (if even then) will it yield up all its treasures.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Socrates in the Phædrus</i></div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">In the dialogue named <i>Phædrus</i> the
same idea is worked out, only to some
extent in reverse order. As in the
<i>Symposium</i> the lover by rightly loving
at last rises to the vision of the Supreme Beauty; so
in the <i>Phædrus</i> it is explained that in reality every
soul <i>has</i> at some time seen that Vision (at the time,
namely, of its true initiation, when it was indeed
winged)—but has forgotten it; and that it is the
dim <i>reminiscence</i> of that Vision, constantly working
within us, which guides us to our earthly loves and
renders their effect upon us so transporting. Long
ago, in some other condition of being, we saw
Beauty herself:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“But of beauty, I repeat again that we saw her
there shining in company with the celestial
forms; and coming to earth we find her here too,
shining in clearness through the clearest aperture
of sense. For sight is the keenest of our bodily senses;
though not by that is wisdom seen; her loveliness
would have been transporting if there had
been a visible image of her, and the same is true of
the loveliness of the other ideas as well. But this is
the privilege of beauty, that she is the loveliest and
also the most palpable to sight. Now he who is not
newly initiated, or who has become corrupted, does
not easily rise out of this world to the sight of
true beauty in the other; he looks only at her
earthly namesake, and instead of being awed at the
sight of her, like a brutish beast he rushes on to
enjoy and beget; he consorts with wantonness, and
is not afraid or ashamed of pursuing pleasure in
violation of nature. But he whose initiation is recent,
and who has been the spectator of many
glories in the other world, is amazed when he sees
anyone having a god-like face or form, which is the
expression of Divine Beauty; and at first a shudder
runs through him, and again the old awe steals
over him; then looking upon the face of his beloved
as of a god he reverences him, and if he were
not afraid of being thought a downright madman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
he would sacrifice to his beloved as to the image
of a god.” <i>The Phædrus of Plato</i>, <i>trans. B. Jowett</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>And again:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“And so the beloved who, like a god, has received
every true and loyal service from his
lover, not in pretence but in reality, being also
himself of a nature friendly to his admirer, if in former
days he has blushed to own his passion and
turned away his lover, because his youthful companions
or others slanderously told him that he
would be disgraced, now as years advance, at the
appointed age and time, is led to receive him into
communion. For fate which has ordained that
there shall be no friendship among the evil has also
ordained that there shall ever be friendship among
the good. And when he has received him into communion
and intimacy, then the beloved is amazed
at the goodwill of the lover; he recognises that the
inspired friend is worth all other friendships or
kinships, which have nothing of friendship in
them in comparison. And when this feeling continues
and he is nearer to him and embraces him,
in gymnastic exercises and at other times of meeting,
then does the fountain of that stream, which
Zeus when he was in love with Ganymede named
desire, overflow upon the lover, and some enters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
into his soul, and some when he is filled flows out
again; and as a breeze or an echo rebounds from
the smooth rocks and returns whence it came, so
does the stream of beauty, passing the eyes which
are the natural doors and windows of the soul, return
again to the beautiful one; there arriving and
quickening the passages of the wings, watering
them and inclining them to grow, and filling the
soul of the beloved also with love.” <i>Ibid.</i></p>

</div>

<p>For Plato the real power which ever moves the
soul is this reminiscence of the Beauty which exists
before all worlds. In the actual world the soul lives
but in anguish, an exile from her true home; but in
the presence of her friend, who reveals the Divine,
she is loosed from her suffering and comes to her
haven of rest.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“And wherever she [the soul] thinks that she
will behold the beautiful one, thither in her
desire she runs. And when she has seen him, and
bathed herself with the waters of desire, her constraint
is loosened, and she is refreshed, and has no
more pangs and pains; and this is the sweetest of
all pleasures at the time, and is the reason why the
soul of the lover will never forsake his beautiful
one, whom he esteems above all; he has forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
mother and brethren and companions, and he
thinks nothing of the neglect and loss of his property;
the rules and proprieties of life, on which
he formerly prided himself, he now despises, and
is ready to sleep like a servant, wherever he is
allowed, as near as he can to his beautiful one, who
is not only the object of his worship, but the only
physician who can heal him in his extreme agony.”

</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">At another time, in the Banquet of
Xenophon, Socrates is again made
to speak at length on the subject of
Love—though not in so inspired a
strain as in Plato:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Truly, to speak for one, I never remember
the time when I was not in love; I know too
that Charmides has had a great many lovers, and
being much beloved has loved again. As for
Critobulus, he is still of an age to love, and to be
beloved; and Nicerates too, who loves so passionately
his wife, at least as report goes, is equally beloved
by her.... And as for you, Callias, you love,
as well as the rest of us; for who is it that is ignorant
of your love for Autolycus? It is the town-talk;
and foreigners, as well as our citizens, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
acquainted with it. The reason for your loving
him, I believe to be that you are both born of illustrious
families; and at the same time are both
possessed of personal qualities that render you yet
more illustrious. For me, I always admired the
sweetness and evenness of your temper; but much
more when I consider that your passion for Autolycus
is placed on a person who has nothing luxurious
or affected in him; but in all things shows
a vigour and temperance worthy of a virtuous
soul; which is a proof at the same time that if he
is infinitely beloved, he deserves to be so. I confess
indeed I am not firmly persuaded whether
there be but one Venus or two, the celestial and
the vulgar; and it may be with this goddess, as
with Jupiter, who has many different names
though there is still but one Jupiter. But I know
very well that both the Venuses have quite
different altars, temples and sacrifices. The vulgar
Venus is worshipped after a common negligent
manner; whereas the celestial one is adored in
purity and sanctity of life. The vulgar inspires
mankind with the love of the body only, but the
celestial fires the mind with the love of the soul,
with friendship, and a generous thirst after noble
actions.... Nor is it hard to prove, Callias, that
gods and heroes have always had more passion and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
esteem for the charms of the soul, than those of the
body: at least this seems to have been the opinion
of our ancient authors. For we may observe in the
fables of antiquity that Jupiter, who loved several
mortals on account of their personal beauty only,
never conferred upon them immortality. Whereas
it was otherwise with Hercules, Castor, Pollux,
and several others; for having admired and applauded
the greatness of their courage and the
beauty of their minds, he enrolled them in the
number of the gods.... You are then infinitely
obliged to the gods, Callias, who have inspired you
with love and friendship for Autolycus, as they
have inspired Critobulus with the same for Amandra;
for real and pure friendship knows no difference
in sexes.” <i>Banquet of Xenophon</i> § viii. (<i>Bohn</i>).</p>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Plutarch, who wrote in the first
century A.D. (nearly 500 years after
Plato), carried on the tradition of his
master, though with an admixture of
later influences; and philosophised about friendship,
on the basis of true love being a reminiscence.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“The rainbow is I suppose a reflection caused
by the sun’s rays falling on a moist cloud,
making us think the appearance is in the cloud.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
Similarly erotic fancy in the case of noble souls
causes a reflection of the memory from things
which here appear and are called beautiful to what
is really divine and lovely and felicitous and wonderful.
But most lovers pursuing and groping
after the semblance of beauty in youths and women,
as in mirrors,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> can derive nothing more certain
than pleasure mixed with pain. And this
seems the love-delirium of Ixion, who instead of
the joy he desired embraced only a cloud, as children
who desire to take the rainbow into their
hands, clutching at whatever they see. But different
is the behaviour of the noble and chaste lover:
for he reflects on the divine beauty that can only be
felt, while he uses the beauty of the visible body
only as an organ of the memory, though he embraces
it and loves it, and associating with it is still
more inflamed in mind. And so neither in the body
do they sit ever gazing at and desiring <i>this</i> light,
nor after death do they return to this world again,
and skulk and loiter about the doors and bedchambers
of newly-married people, disagreeable
ghosts of pleasure-loving and sensual men and
women, who do not rightly deserve the name of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
lovers. For the true lover, when he has got into the
other world and associated with beauties as much
as is lawful, has wings and is initiated and passes
his time above in the presence of his Deity, dancing
and waiting upon him, until he goes back to
the meadows of the Moon and Aphrodite, and
sleeping there commences a new existence. But
this is a subject too high for the present occasion.”

<p class="dropcap-pic">The fact, already mentioned, that the
<i>romance</i> of love among the Greeks
was chiefly felt towards male friends,
naturally led to their poetry being
largely inspired by friendship; and Greek literature
contains such a great number of poems of this sort,
that I have thought it worth while to dedicate the
main portion of the following section to quotations
from them. No translations of course can do justice
to the beauty of the originals, but the few specimens
given may help to illustrate the depth and tenderness
as well as the temperance and sobriety which
on the whole characterised Greek feeling on this
subject, at any rate during the best period of Hellenic
culture. The remainder of the section is devoted
to Roman poetry of the time of the Cæsars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Motive of Homer’s Iliad</i></div>

<p>It is not always realised that the Iliad of Homer
turns upon the motive of friendship, but the extracts
immediately following will perhaps make this
clear. E. F. M. Benecke in his <i>Position of Women in
Greek Poetry</i> (p. 76) says of the Iliad:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“It is a story of which the main motive is the love
of Achilles for Patroclus. This solution is astoundingly
simple, and yet it took me so long to
bring myself to accept it that I am quite ready to
forgive anyone who feels a similar hesitation. But
those who do accept it cannot fail to observe, on
further consideration, how thoroughly suitable a
motive of this kind would be in a national Greek
epic. For this is the motive running through the
whole of Greek life, till that life was transmuted by
the influence of Macedonia. The lover-warriors
Achilles and Patroclus are the direct spiritual
ancestors of the sacred Band of Thebans, who died
to a man on the field of Chæronæa.”</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>J. A. Symonds on the same</i></div>

<p>The following two quotations are from <i>The Greek
Poets</i> by J. A. Symonds, ch. iii. p. 80 <i>et seq.</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“The <i>Iliad</i> therefore has for its whole subject
the passion of Achilles—that ardent energy
or μῆνις of the hero which displayed itself first as
anger against Agamemnon, and afterwards as love<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
for the lost Patroclus. The truth of this was perceived
by one of the greatest poets and profoundest,
critics of the modern world, Dante. When Dante,
in the <i>Inferno</i>, wished to describe Achilles, he
wrote, with characteristic brevity:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent11">“Achille</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Che per amore al fine combatteo.”</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent11">(“Achilles</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who at the last was brought to fight by love.”)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“In this pregnant sentence Dante sounded the
whole depth of the <i>Iliad</i>. The wrath of Achilles for
Agamemnon, which prevented him at first from
fighting; the love of Achilles, passing the love of
women, for Patroclus, which induced him to forego
his anger and to fight at last; these are the two
poles on which the <i>Iliad</i> turns.”</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Achilles and Patroclus</i></div>

<p>After his quarrel with Agamemnon, not even all
the losses of the Greeks and the entreaties of Agamemnon
himself will induce Achilles to fight—not
till Patroclus is slain by Hector—Patroclus, his dear
friend “whom above all my comrades I honoured,
even as myself.” Then he rises up, dons his armour,
and driving the Trojans before him revenges himself
on the body of Hector. But Patroclus lies yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
unburied; and when the fighting is over, to Achilles
comes the ghost of his dead friend:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“The son of Peleus, by the shore of the roaring
sea lay, heavily groaning, surrounded by his
Myrmidons; on a fair space of sand he lay, where
the waves lapped the beach. Then slumber took
him, loosing the cares of his heart, and mantling
softly around him, for sorely wearied were his
radiant limbs with driving Hector on by windy
Troy. There to him came the soul of poor Patroclus,
in all things like himself, in stature, and in the
beauty of his eyes and voice, and on the form was
raiment like his own. He stood above the hero’s
head, and spake to him:—</p>

<p>“‘Sleepest thou, and me hast thou forgotten,
Achilles? Not in my life wert thou neglectful of
me, but in death. Bury me soon, that I may pass
the gates of Hades. Far off the souls, the shadows
of the dead, repel me, nor suffer me to join them
on the river bank; but, as it is, thus I roam around
the wide-doored house of Hades. But stretch to
me thy hand I entreat; for never again shall I return
from Hades when once ye shall have given
me the meed of funeral fire. Nay, never shall we
sit in life apart from our dear comrades and take
counsel together. But me hath hateful fate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
enveloped—fate that was mine at the moment of
my birth. And for thyself, divine Achilles, it is
doomed to die beneath the noble Trojan’s wall.
Another thing I say to thee, and bid thee do it if
thou wilt obey me:—lay not my bones apart from
thine, Achilles, but lay them together; for we were
brought up together in your house, when Menœtius
brought me, a child, from Opus to your house,
because of woeful bloodshed on the day in which
I slew the son of Amphidamas, myself a child, not
willing it but in anger at our games. Then did the
horseman, Peleus, take me, and rear me in his
house, and cause me to be called thy squire. So
then let one grave also hide the bones of both of us,
the golden urn thy goddess-mother gave to thee.’</p>

<p>“Him answered swift-footed Achilles:—</p>

<p>‘Why, dearest and most honoured, hast thou
hither come, to lay on me this thy behest? All
things most certainly will I perform, and bow to
what thou biddest. But stand thou near: even for
one moment let us throw our arms upon each
other’s neck, and take our fill of sorrowful wailing.’</p>

<p>“So spake he, and with his outstretched hands he
clasped, but could not seize. The spirit, earthward,
like smoke, vanished with a shriek. Then all astonished
arose Achilles, and beat his palms together,
and spake a piteous word:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>‘Heavens! is there then, among the dead, soul
and the shade of life, but thought is theirs no more
at all? For through the night the soul of poor Patroclus
stood above my head, wailing and sorrowing
loud, and bade me do his will; it was the very
semblance of himself.’</p>

<p>“So spake he, and in the hearts of all of them he
raised desire of lamentation; and while they were
yet mourning, to them appeared rose-fingered
dawn about the piteous corpse.” <i>Iliad</i>, xxiii.

<p class="dropcap">[And great] “was the reward of
the true love of Achilles towards
his lover Patroclus—his lover and not his
love (the notion that Patroclus was the beloved
one is a foolish error into which Æschylus has fallen,
for Achilles was surely the fairer of the two,
fairer also than all the other heroes; and, as
Homer informs us, he was still beardless, and
younger far). And greatly as the gods honour the
virtue of love, still the return of love on the part of
the beloved to the lover is more admired and
valued and rewarded by them, for the lover has a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
nature more divine and worthy of worship. Now
Achilles was quite aware, for he had been told by
his mother, that he might avoid death and return
home, and live to a good old age, if he abstained
from slaying Hector. Nevertheless he gave his life
to revenge his friend, and dared to die, not only on
his behalf, but after his death. Wherefore the

remarks in the <i>Symposium</i> that the
tragic poet was wrong to make Achilles the lover
of Patroclus, seeing that Patroclus was the elder of
the two, and that Achilles was the youngest and
most beautiful of all the Greeks. The fact however
is that Homer raises no question in our minds
about the relation of lover and beloved. Achilles
and Patroclus are comrades. Their friendship is
equal. It was only the reflective activity of the
Greek mind, working upon the Homeric legend
by the light of subsequent custom, which introduced
these distinctions.” <i>The Greek Poets</i>, ch. iii.

</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">The quotations we have given from
Plato and others show the very high
ideal of friendship which obtained in
the old world, and the respect accorded
to it. With the incoming of the Christian
centuries, and the growth of Alexandrian and
Germanic influences, a change began to take place.
Woman rose to greater freedom and dignity and
influence than before. The romance of love began to
centre round her.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The days of chivalry brought a
new devotion into the world, and the Church exalted
the Virgin Mother to the highest place in
heaven. Friendship between men ceased to be regarded
in the old light—<i>i.e.</i>, as a thing of deep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
feeling, and an important social institution. It was
even, here and there, looked on with disfavour—and
lapses from the purity or chastity of its standard
were readily suspected and violently reprobated.
Certainly it survived in the monastic life for a long
period; but though inspiring this to a great extent,
its influence was not generally acknowledged. The
Family, in the modern and more limited sense of
the word (as opposed to the clan), became the recognised
unit of social life, and the ideal centre of all
good influences (as illustrated in the worship of the
Holy Family). At the same time, by this very
shrinkage of the Family, as well as by other influences,
the solidarity of society became to some
extent weakened, and gradually the more communistic
forms of the early world gave place to the
individualism of the commercial period.</p>

<p>The special sentiment of comrade-love or attachment
(being a thing inherent in human nature)
remained of course through the Christian centuries,
as before, and unaltered—except that being no
longer recognised it became a private and personal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
affair, running often powerfully enough beneath the
surface of society, but openly unacknowledged, and
so far deprived of some of its dignity and influence.
Owing to this fact there is nothing, for this period,
to be quoted in the way of general ideal or public
opinion on the subject of friendship, and the following
sections therefore become limited to the expression
of individual sentiments and experiences, in
prose and poetry. These we find, during the mediæval
period, largely colored by religion; while at
the Renaissance and afterwards they are evidently
affected by Greek associations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Saint Augustine</i></div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-f.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Following are some passages from
S. Augustine:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“In those years when I first began
to teach in my native town, I had
made a friend, one who through having the same
interests was very dear to me, one of my own age,
and like me in the first flower of youth. We had
grown up together, and went together to school,
and used to play together. But he was not yet so
great a friend as afterwards, nor even then was our
friendship true; for friendship is not true unless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
Thou cementest it between those who are united
to Thee by that ‘love which is shed abroad in our
hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.’
Yet our friendship was but too sweet, and fermented
by the pursuit of kindred studies. For I had
turned him aside from the true faith (of which as
a youth he had but an imperfect grasp) to pernicious
and superstitious fables, for which my mother
grieved over me. And now in mind he erred
with me, and my soul could not endure to be
separated from him. But lo, Thou didst follow
close behind Thy fugitives, Thou—both God of
vengeance and fountain of mercies—didst convert
us by wonderful ways; behold, Thou didst take
him out of this life, when scarcely a year had our
close intimacy lasted—sweet to me beyond the
sweetness of my whole life....</p>

<p>“No ray of light pierced the gloom with which
my heart was enveloped by this grief, and wherever
I looked I beheld death. My native place was
a torment to me, and my father’s house strangely
joyless; and whatever I had shared with him,
without him was now turned into a huge torture.
My longing eyes sought him everywhere, and
found him not; and I hated the very places, because
he was not in them, neither could they say to
me ‘he is coming,’ as they used to do when he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
alive and was absent. And I became a great puzzle
to myself, and I asked my soul why it was so sad,
and why so disquieted within me; and it knew not
what to answer. And if I said ‘Trust thou in God,’
it rightly did not obey; for that dearest one whom
it had lost was both truer and better than that
phantasm in which it was bidden to trust. Weeping
was the only thing which was sweet to me, and it
succeeded my friend in the dearest place in my
heart.” <i>S. Augustine, Confessions</i>, bk. 4, ch. iv.
<i>Trans. by Rev. W. H. Hutchings, M.A.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“I was miserable, and miserable is every soul
which is fettered by the love of perishable
things; he is torn to pieces when he loses them,
and then he perceives how miserable he was in
reality while he possessed them. And so was I
then, and I wept most bitterly, and in that bitterness
I found rest. Thus was I miserable, and that
miserable life I held dearer than my friend. For
though I would fain have changed it, yet to it I
clung even more than to him; and I cannot say
whether I would have parted with it for his sake,
as it is related, if true, that Orestes and Pylades
were willing to do, for they would gladly have
died for each other, or together, for they preferred
death to separation from each other. But in me
a feeling which I cannot explain, and one of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
contradictory nature had arisen; for I had at once an
unbearable weariness of living, and a fear of dying.
For I believe the more I loved him, the more
I hated and dreaded death which had taken him
from me, and regarded it as a most cruel enemy;
and I felt as if it would soon devour all men, now
that its power had reached him.... For I marvelled
that other mortals lived, because he whom
I had loved, without thought of his ever dying,
was dead; and that I still lived—I who was another
self—when he was gone, was a greater marvel
still. Well said a certain one of his friend,
‘Thou half of my soul;’ for I felt that his soul and
mine were ‘one soul in two bodies’: and therefore
life was to me horrible, because I hated to live as
half of a life; and therefore perhaps I feared to die,
lest he should wholly die whom I had loved so
greatly.” <i>Ibid</i>, ch. vi.</p>

<p class="dropcap-pic">It is interesting to see, in these extracts
from S. Augustine, and in
those which follow from Montalembert,
the points of likeness and
difference between the Christian ideal of love and
that of Plato. Both are highly transcendental, both
seem to contemplate an inner union of souls, beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
the reach of space and time; but in Plato the
union is in contemplation of the Eternal Beauty,
while in the Christian teachers it is in devotion to a
personal God.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“If inanimate nature was to them an abundant
source of pleasure they had a life still more
lively and elevated in the life of the heart, in the
double love which burned in them—the love of
their brethren inspired and consecrated by the
love of God.” <i>Monks of the West</i>, introdn., ch. v.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Everything invited and encouraged them
to choose one or several souls as the intimate
companions of their life.... And to prove how
little the divine love, thus understood and practised,
tends to exclude or chill the love of man for
man, never was human eloquence more touching
or more sincere than in that immortal elegy by
which S. Bernard laments a lost brother snatched
by death from the cloister:—‘Flow, flow my tears,
so eager to flow! he who prevented your flowing
is here no more! It is not he who is dead, it is I who
now live only to die. Why, O why have we loved,
and why have we lost each other.’” <i>Ibid.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“The mutual affection which reigned among
the monks flowed as a mighty stream through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
the annals of the cloister. It has left its trace even
in the ‘formulas,’ collected with care by modern
erudition.... The correspondence of the most
illustrious, of Geoffrey de Vendôme, of Pierre le
Vénérable, and of S. Bernard, give proofs of it at
every page.” <i>Ibid.</i></p>

monks are full of expressions of the
same ardent affection. Montalembert

two near relatives whom he wished to draw to
Bec, “my eyes ardently desire to behold you; my
arms expand to embrace you; my lips sigh for
your kisses; all the life that remains to me is consumed
with waiting for you. I hope in praying,
and I pray in hoping—come and taste how gracious
the Lord is—you cannot fully know it while
you find sweetness in the world.”</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>To his Friend Lanfranc</i></div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“‘Far from the eyes, far from the heart’ say the
vulgar. Believe nothing of it; if it was so, the
farther you were distant from me the cooler my
love for you would be; whilst on the contrary,
the less I can enjoy your presence, the more the
desire of that pleasure burns in the soul of your
friend.”</p>

because I can say nothing more to him whom
I love. All who know Gondulph and Anselm
know well what this means, and how much love is
understood in these two names.” ... “How could
I forget thee? Can a man forget one who is placed
like a seal upon his heart? In thy silence I know
that thou lovest me; and thou also, when I say nothing,
thou knowest that I love thee. Not only
have I no doubt of thee, but I answer for thee that
thou art sure of me. What can my letter tell thee
that thou knowest not already, thou who art my
second soul? Go into the secret place of thy heart,
look there at thy love for me, and thou shalt see
mine for thee.” ... “Thou knewest how much
I love thee, but I knew it not. He who has separated
us has alone instructed me how dear to me
thou wert. No, I knew not before the experience
of thy absence how sweet it was to have thee, how
bitter to have thee not. Thou hast another friend
whom thou hast loved as much or more than me to
console thee, but I have no longer thee!—thee!
thee! thou understandest? and nothing to replace
thee. Those who rejoice in the possession of thee
may perhaps be offended by what I say. Ah! let

embraced and kissed each other, and gave thanks
to God that they were found. And they swore
fealty and friendship and fellowship perpetual,
the one to the other, on the sword of Amile,
wherein were relics.” Thence they went together
to the court of “Charles, king of France.”</p>

<p>Here soon after, Amis took Amile’s place in a
tournament, saved his life from a traitor, and won
for him the King’s daughter to wife. But so it happened
that, not long after, he himself was stricken
with leprosy and brought to Amile’s door. And
when Amile and his royal bride knew who it was
they were sore grieved, and they brought him in
and placed him on a fair bed, and put all that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
had at his service. And it came to pass one night
“whenas Amis and Amile lay in one chamber
without other company, that God sent to Amis
Raphael his angel, who said to him: ‘Sleepest thou,
Amis?’ And he, who deemed that Amile had
called to him, answered: ‘I sleep not, fair sweet
fellow.’ Then the angel said to him: ‘Thou hast
answered well, for thou art the fellow of the citizens
of heaven, and thou hast followed after Job,
and Thoby in patience. Now I am Raphael, an
angel of our Lord, and am come to tell thee of a
medicine for thine healing, whereas he hath heard
thy prayers. Thou shalt tell to Amile thy fellow,
that he slay his two children and wash thee in their
blood, and thence thou shalt get the healing of
thy body.’”</p>

<p>Amis was shocked when he heard these words,
and at first refused to tell Amile; but the latter
had also heard the angel’s voice, and pressed him
to tell. Then, when he knew, he too was sorely
grieved. But at last he determined in his mind not
even to spare his children for the sake of his friend,
and going secretly to their chamber he slew them,
and bringing some of their blood washed Amis—who
immediately was healed. He then arrayed
Amis in his best clothes and, after going to the
church to give thanks, they met Amile’s wife who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
(not knowing all) rejoiced greatly too. But Amile,
going apart again to the children’s chamber to
weep over them, found them at play in bed, with
only a thread of crimson round their throats to
mark what had been done!</p>

<p>The two knights fell afterwards and were killed
in the same battle; “for even as God had joined
them together by good accord in their life-days,
so in their death they were not sundered.” And a
miracle was added, for even when they were
buried apart from each other the two coffins leapt
together in the night and were found side by side
in the morning.</p>

</div>

<p>Of this story Mr. Jacobs, in his introduction to
William Morris’ translation, says: “Amis and Amile
were the David and Jonathan, the Orestes and
Pylades, of the mediæval world.” There were some
thirty other versions of the legend “in almost all
the tongues of Western and Northern Europe”—their
“peerless friendship” having given them a
place among the mediæval saints. (See <i>Old French
Romances</i> trans. by William Morris, London, 1896.)</p>

<p class="dropcap-pic">It may not be out of place here, and
before passing on to the times of the
Renaissance and Modern Europe, to
give one or two extracts relating to
Eastern countries. The honour paid to friendship
in Persia, Arabia, Syria and other Oriental lands
has always been great, and the tradition of this
attachment there should be especially interesting to
us, as having arisen independently of classic or
Christian ideals. The poets of Persia, Saadi and
Jalal-ud-din Rumi (13th cent.), Hafiz (14th cent.),
Jami (15th cent.), and others, have drawn much of
their inspiration from this source; but unfortunately
for those who cannot read the originals, their
work has been scantily translated, and the translations
themselves are not always very reliable.
The extraordinary way in which, following the
method of the Sufis, and of Plato, they identify the
mortal and the divine love, and see in their beloved
an image or revelation of God himself, makes their
poems difficult of comprehension to the Western<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
mind. Apostrophes to Love, Wine, and Beauty
often, with them, bear a frankly twofold sense,
material and spiritual. To these poets of the mid-region
of the earth, the bitter antagonism between
matter and spirit, which like an evil dream has
haunted so long both the extreme Western and the
extreme Eastern mind, scarcely exists; and even the
body “which is a portion of the dust-pit” has
become perfect and divine.</p>

<p>Suleyman the Magnificent.—The story of Suleyman’s
attachment to his Vezir Ibrahim is told as
follows by Stanley Lane-Poole:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Suleyman, great as he was, shared his greatness
with a second mind, to which his reign
owed much of its brilliance. The Grand Vezir
Ibrahim was the counterpart of the Grand Monarch
Suleyman. He was the son of a sailor at Parga,
and had been captured by corsairs, by whom he
was sold to be the slave of a widow at Magnesia.
Here he passed into the hands of the young prince
Suleyman, then Governor of Magnesia, and soon
his extraordinary talents and address brought him
promotion.... From being Grand Falconer on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
accession of Suleyman, he rose to be first minister
and almost co-Sultan in 1523.</p>

<p>“He was the object of the Sultan’s tender regard:
an emperor knows better than most men how solitary
is life without friendship and love, and Suleyman
loved this man more than a brother. Ibrahim
was not only a friend, he was an entertaining and
instructive companion. He read Persian, Greek
and Italian; he knew how to open unknown worlds
to the Sultan’s mind, and Suleyman drank in his
Vezir’s wisdom with assiduity. They lived together:
their meals were shared in common; even
their beds were in the same room. The Sultan gave
his sister in marriage to the sailor’s son, and Ibrahim
was at the summit of power.” <i>Turkey, Story of

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-j.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">J. S. Buckingham, in his <i>Travels
in Assyria, Media and Persia</i>, speaking
of his guide whom he had engaged at
Bagdad, and who was supposed to
have left his heart behind him in that city, says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Amidst all this I was at a loss to conceive
how the Dervish could find much enjoyment
[in the expedition] while laboring under the strong
passion which I supposed he must then be feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
for the object of his affections at Bagdad, whom he
had quitted with so much reluctance. What was
my surprise however on seeking an explanation of
this seeming inconsistency, to find it was the son,
and not the daughter, of his friend Elias who held
so powerful a hold on his heart. I shrank back from
the confession as a man would recoil from a serpent
on which he had unexpectedly trodden ...
but in answer to enquiries naturally suggested by
the subject he declared he would rather suffer
death than do the slightest harm to so pure, so
innocent, so heavenly a creature as this....</p>

<p>“I took the greatest pains to ascertain by a severe
and minute investigation, how far it might be possible
to doubt of the purity of the passion by which
this Affgan Dervish was possessed, and whether
it deserved to be classed with that described as prevailing
among the ancient Greeks; and the result
fully satisfied me that both were the same. Ismael
was however surprised beyond measure when I assured
him that such a feeling was not known at all
among the peoples of Europe.” <i>Travels, &amp;c.</i>, 2nd
edition, vol. 1, p. 159.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Another Story</i></div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“The Dervish added a striking instance of the
force of these attachments, and the sympathy
which was felt in the sorrows to which they led, by
the following fact from his own history. The place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
of his residence, and of his usual labour, was near
the bridge of the Tigris, at the gate of the Mosque
of the Vizier. While he sat here, about five or six
years since, surrounded by several of his friends
who came often to enjoy his conversation and
beguile the tedium of his work, he observed, passing
among the crowd, a young and beautiful
Turkish boy, whose eyes met his, as if by destiny,
and they remained fixedly gazing on each other for
some time. The boy, after ‘blushing like the first
hue of a summer morning,’ passed on, frequently
turning back to look on the person who had regarded
him so ardently. The Dervish felt his heart
‘revolve within him,’ for such was his expression,
and a cold sweat came across his brow. He hung
his head upon his graving-tool in dejection, and excused
himself to those about him by saying he felt
suddenly ill. Shortly afterwards the boy returned,
and after walking to and fro several times, drawing
nearer and nearer, as if under the influence of some
attracting charm, he came up to his observer and
said, ‘Is it really true, then, that you love me?’
‘This,’ said Ismael, ‘was a dagger in my heart;
I could make no reply.’ The friends who were near
him, and now saw all explained, asked him if there
had been any previous acquaintance existing between
them. He assured them that they had never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
seen each other before. ‘Then,’ they replied, ‘such
an event must be from God.’</p>

<p>“The boy continued to remain for a while with
this party, told with great frankness the name and
rank of his parents, as well as the place of his residence,
and promised to repeat his visit on the following
day. He did this regularly for several
months in succession, sitting for hours by the
Dervish, and either singing to him or asking him
interesting questions, to beguile his labours, until
as Ismael expressed himself, ‘though they were
still two bodies they became one soul.’ The youth
at length fell sick, and was confined to his bed,
during which time his lover, Ismael, discontinued
entirely his usual occupations and abandoned himself
completely to the care of his beloved. He
watched the changes of his disease with more than
the anxiety of a parent, and never quitted his bedside,
night or day. Death at length separated them;
but even when the stroke came the Dervish could
not be prevailed on to quit the corpse. He constantly
visited the grave that contained the remains
of all he held dear on earth, and planting
myrtles and flowers there after the manner of the
East, bedewed them daily with his tears. His
friends sympathised powerfully in his distress,
which he said ‘continued to feed his grief’ until he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
pined away to absolute illness, and was near following
the fate of him whom he deplored.” <i>Ibid</i>, p. 160.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Explanation</i></div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“From all this, added to many other examples
of a similar kind, related as happening between
persons who had often been pointed out to
me in Arabia and Persia, I could no longer doubt
the existence in the East of an affection for male
youths, of as pure and honorable a kind as that
which is felt in Europe for those of the other
sex ... and it would be as unjust to suppose that
this necessarily implied impurity of desire as to
contend that no one could admire a lovely countenance
and a beautiful form in the other sex, and
still be inspired with sentiments of the most pure
and honorable nature towards the object of his
admiration.” <i>Ibid</i>, p. 163.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“One powerful reason why this passion may
exist in the East, while it is quite unknown
in the West, is probably the seclusion of women in
the former, and the freedom of access to them in
the latter.... Had they [the Asiatics] the unrestrained
intercourse which we enjoy with such superior
beings as the virtuous and accomplished
females of our own country they would find nothing
in nature so deserving of their love as
these.” <i>Ibid</i>, p. 165.</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">With the Renaissance, and the impetus
it gave at that time to the study
of Greek and Roman models, the
exclusive domination of Christianity
and the Church was broken. A literature of
friendship along classic lines began to spring up.
Montaigne (b. 1533) was saturated with classic
learning. His essays were doubtless largely formed
upon the model of Plutarch. His friendship with
Stephen de la Boëtie was evidently of a romantic
and absorbing character. It is referred to in the following
passage by William Hazlitt; and the description
of it occupies a large part of Montaigne’s
Essay on Friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“The most important event of his counsellor’s
life at Bordeaux was the friendship which he
there formed with Stephen de la Boëtie, an affection
which makes a streak of light in modern biography
almost as beautiful as that left us by Lord
Brook and Sir Philip Sydney. Our essayist and his
friend esteemed, before they saw, each other. La
Boëtie had written a little work<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in which Montaigne
recognised sentiments congenial with his
own, and which indeed bespeak a soul formed in
the mould of classic times. Of Montaigne, la
Boëtie had also heard accounts, which made him
eager to behold him, and at length they met at
a large entertainment given by one of the magistrates
of Bordeaux. They saw and loved, and were
thenceforward all in all to each other. The picture
that Montaigne in his essays draws of this friendship
is in the highest degree beautiful and touching;
nor does la Boëtie’s idea of what is due to this
sacred bond betwixt soul and soul fall far short of
the grand perception which filled the exalted mind
of his friend.... Montaigne married at the age of
33, but, as he informs us, not of his own wish or
choice. ‘Might I have had my wish,’ says he,
‘I would not have married Wisdom herself if she
would have had me.’” <i>Life of Montaigne</i>, <i>by Wm.
Hazlitt</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Montaigne on Friendship</i></div>

<p>The following is from Montaigne’s Essay, bk. 1,
ch. xxvii:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“As to marriage, besides that it is a covenant,
the <i>making</i> of which is only free, but the continuance
in it forced and compelled, having another
dependence than that of our own free will,
and a bargain moreover commonly contracted to
other ends, there happen a thousand intricacies in
it to unravel, enough to break the thread, and to
divert the current, of a lively affection: whereas
friendship has no manner of business or traffic with
anything but itself.... For the rest, what we commonly
call friends and friendships are nothing but
an acquaintance and connection, contracted either
by accident or upon some design, by means of
which there happens some little intercourse betwixt
our souls: but, in the friendship I speak of,
they mingle and melt into one piece, with so
universal a mixture that there is left no more sign
of the seam by which they were first conjoined. If
any one should importune me to give a reason
why I loved him [Stephen de la Boëtie] I feel it
could no otherwise be expressed than by making
answer, ‘Because it was he; because it was I.’
There is, beyond what I am able to say, I know
not what inexplicable and inevitable power that
brought on this union. We sought one another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
long before we met, and from the characters we
heard of one another, which wrought more upon
our affections than in reason mere reports should
do, and, as I think, by some secret appointment of
heaven; we embraced each other in our names;
and at our first meeting, which was accidentally at
a great city entertainment, we found ourselves so
mutually pleased with one another—we became
at once mutually so endeared—that thenceforward
nothing was so near to us as one another....</p>

<p>“Common friendships will admit of division,
one may love the beauty of this, the good humour
of that person, the liberality of a third, the paternal
affection of a fourth, the fraternal love of a fifth,
and so on. But this friendship that possesses the
whole soul, and there rules and sways with an absolute
sovereignty, can admit of no rival.... In
good earnest, if I compare all the rest of my life
with the four years I had the happiness to enjoy
the sweet society of this excellent man, ’tis nothing
but smoke, but an obscure and tedious night.
From the day that I lost him I have only led a sorrowful
and languishing life; and the very pleasures
that present themselves to me, instead of
administering anything of consolation, double my
affliction for his loss. We were halves throughout,
and to that degree that, methinks, by outliving
him I defraud him of his part.”</p>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Philip Sidney, born 1554, was
remarkable for his strong personal
attachments. Chief among his allies
were his school-mate and distant relative,
Fulke Greville (born in the same year as himself),
and his college friend Edward Dyer (also
about his own age). He wrote youthful verses to
both of them. The following, according to the
fashion of the age, are in the form of an invocation
to the pastoral god Pan:—</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Philip Sidney and Hubert Languet</i></div>

<p>An interesting friendship existed also between Sidney
and the well-known French Protestant, Hubert
Languet—many years his senior—whose conversation
and correspondence helped much in the formation
of Sidney’s character. These two had shared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
together the perils of the massacre of S. Bartholomew,
and had both escaped from France across the
Rhine to Germany, where they lived in close intimacy
at Frankfort for a length of time; and after
this a warm friendship and steady correspondence—varied
by occasional meetings—continued between
the two until Languet’s death. Languet had been
Professor of Civil Law at Padua, and from 1550 forwards
was recognised as one of the leading political
agents of the Protestant Powers.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“The elder man immediately discerned in Sidney
a youth of no common quality, and the
attachment he conceived for him savoured of romance.
We possess a long series of Latin letters
from Languet to his friend, which breathe the tenderest
spirit of affection, mingled with wise counsel
and ever watchful thought for the young man’s
higher interests.... There must have been something
inexplicably attractive in his [Sidney’s]
person and his genius at this time; for the tone of
Languet’s correspondence can only be matched
by that of Shakespeare in the sonnets written for
his unknown friend.” <i>Sir Philip Sidney</i>, <i>English
Men of Letters Series</i>, pp. 27, 28.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>Of this relation Fox Bourne says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“No love-oppressed youth can write with more
earnest passion and more fond solicitude,
or can be troubled with more frequent fears and
more causeless jealousies, than Languet, at this
time 55 years old, shows in his letters to Sidney,
now 19.”</p>

<p class="dropcap-pic">It may be appropriate here to introduce
two or three sonnets from
Michel Angelo (b. 1475). Michel
Angelo, one of the greatest, perhaps
the greatest, artist of the Italian Renaissance, was
deeply imbued with the Greek spirit. His conception
of Love was close along the line of Plato’s. For
him the body was the symbol, the expression, the
dwelling place of some divine beauty. The body
may be loved, but it should only be loved <i>as</i> a symbol,
not for itself. Diotima in the <i>Symposium</i> had said
that in our mortal loves we first come to recognise
(dimly) the divine form of beauty which is Eternal.
Maximus Tyrius (Dissert. xxvi. 8) commenting on
this, confirms it, saying that nowhere else but in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
human form, “the loveliest and most intelligent of
bodily creatures,” does the light of divine beauty
shine so clear. Michel Angelo carried on the conception,
gave it noble expression, and held to it
firmly in the midst of a society which was certainly
willing enough to love the body (or try to love it)
merely for its own sake. And Giordano Bruno
(b. 1550) at a later date wrote as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“All the loves—if they be heroic and not
purely animal, or what is called natural, and
slaves to generation as instruments in some way
of nature—have for object the divinity, and tend
towards divine beauty, which first is communicated to,
and shines in, souls, and from them or
rather through them is communicated to bodies;
whence it is that well-ordered affection loves the
body or corporeal beauty, insomuch as it is an indication
of beauty of spirit.” <i>Gli Eroici Furori</i> (dial.
iii. 13), <i>trans. L. Williams</i>.</p>

<p class="dropcap-pic">The labours of Von Scheffler and
others have now pretty conclusively
established that the love-poems of
Michel Angelo were for the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
part written to male friends—though this fact was
disguised by the pious frauds of his nephew, who
edited them in the first instance. Following are
three of his sonnets, translated by J. A. Symonds.
It will be seen that the last line of the first contains
a play on the name of his friend:—</p>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Francis Bacon’s essay <i>Of friendship</i>
is known to everybody. Notwithstanding
the somewhat cold and
pragmatic style and genius of the
author, the subject seems to inspire him with a
certain enthusiasm; and some good things are said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“But we may go farther and affirm most truly
that it is a mere and miserable solitude to want
true friends, without which the world is but a
wilderness; and even in this scene also of solitude,
whosoever in the frame of his nature and affections
is unfit for friendship, he taketh it of the
beast, and not from humanity. A principal fruit of
friendship is the ease and discharge of the fulness
of the heart, which passions of all kinds do cause
and induce. We know diseases of stoppings and
suffocations are the most dangerous in the body;
and it is not much otherwise in the mind: you may
take sarza to open the liver, steel to open the
spleen, flower of sulphur for the lungs, castoreum
for the brain; but no receipt openeth the heart
but a true friend, to whom you may impart griefs,
joys, fears, hopes, suspicions, counsels, and whatsoever
lieth upon the heart to oppress it, in a kind
of civil shrift or confession....</p>

<p>“Certainly if a man would give it a hard phrase,
those that want friends to open themselves unto,
are cannibals of their own hearts; but one thing is
most admirable (wherewith I will conclude this
first fruit of friendship) which is, that this communicating
of a man’s self to his friend worketh
two contrary effects, for it redoubleth joys, and
cutteth griefs in halfs; for there is no man that imparteth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
his joys to his friend, but he joyeth the
more, and no man that imparteth his griefs to his
friend, but he grieveth the less.” Essay 27, <i>Of

of Elizabethan life and literature. “Were it not for
the fact,” says F. T. Furnivall, “that many critics
really deserving the name of Shakespeare students,
and not Shakespeare fools, have held the Sonnets to
be merely dramatic, I could not have conceived that
poems so intensely and evidently autobiographic

what they are—the records of his own loves and

expect, capable of friendship, passionate friendship,
towards both men and women. Perhaps this marks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
the highest reach of temperament. That there are
cases in which devotion to a man-friend altogether
replaces the love of the opposite sex is curiously
shown by the following extract from Sir Thomas
Browne:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“I never yet cast a true affection on a woman;
but I have loved my friend as I do virtue, my
soul, my God.... I love my friend before myself,
and yet methinks I do not love him enough: some
few months hence my multiplied affection will
make me believe I have not loved him at all. When
I am from him, I am dead till I be with him; when
I am with him, I am not satisfied, but would be still
nearer him.... This noble affection falls not on
vulgar and common constitutions, but on such
as are marked for virtue: he that can love his
friend with this noble ardour, will in a competent
degree affect all.” <i>Sir Thomas Browne</i>, <i>Religio

two passages from Macaulay’s History

the remarkable intimacy between the
Young Prince William of Orange and “a gentleman
of his household” named Bentinck. William’s
escape from a malignant attack of small-pox</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“was attributed partly to his own singular equanimity,
and partly to the intrepid and indefatigable,
friendship of Bentinck. From the hands of Bentinck
alone William took food and medicine—by
Bentinck alone William was lifted from his bed
and laid down in it. ‘Whether Bentinck slept or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>

that through sixteen days and nights, I never once

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“It is a common observation that differences of
taste, understanding, and disposition are no
impediments to friendship, and that the closest intimacies
often exist between minds, each of which
supplies what is wanting in the other. Lady
Churchill was loved and even worshipped by
Anne. The princess could not live apart from the
object of her romantic fondness. She married, and
was a faithful and even an affectionate wife; but
Prince George, a dull man, whose chief pleasures
were derived from his dinner and his bottle, acquired
over her no influence comparable to that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>

<p class="dropcap-pic">That the tradition of Greek thought
was not quite obliterated in England
by the Puritan movement is shown
by the writings of Archbishop Potter,
who speaks with approval of friendship as followed
among the Greeks, “not only in private, but by the
public allowance and encouragement of their laws;
for they thought there could be no means more
effectual to excite their youth to noble undertakings,
nor any greater security to their commonwealths,
than this generous passion.” He then quotes Athenæus,
saying that “free commonwealths and all
those states that consulted the advancement of
their own honour, seem to have been unanimous in
establishing laws to encourage and reward it.” <i>John
Potter</i>, <i>Antiquities of Greece</i>, 1698.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Winckelmann’s Letters</i></div>

<p>The 18th century however in England, with
its leaning towards formalism, was perhaps not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
favorable to the understanding of the Greek
spirit. At any rate there is not much to show in that
direction. In Germany the classical tradition in art
was revived by Raphael Mengs, while Winckelmann,
the art critic, showed himself one of the best
interpreters of the Hellenic world that has ever
lived. His letters too, to his personal friends,
breathe a spirit of the tenderest and most passionate
devotion: “Friendship,” he says, “without love is
mere acquaintanceship.” Winckelmann met, in
1762, in Rome, a young nobleman, Reinhold von
Berg, to whom he became deeply attached:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Almost at first sight there sprang up, on
Winckelmann’s side, an attachment as romantic,
emotional and passionate as love. In a
letter to his friend he said, ‘From the first moment
an indescribable attraction towards you, excited by
something more than form and feature, caused me
to catch an echo of that harmony which passes
human understanding and which is the music of
the everlasting concord of things.... I was aware
of the deep consent of our spirits, the instant I saw
you.’ And in a later letter: ‘No name by which
I might call you would be sweet enough or sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
for my love; all that I could say would be far
too feeble to give utterance to my heart and soul.
Truly friendship came from heaven and was not
created by mere human impulses.... My one
friend, I love you more than any living thing, and
time nor chance nor age can ever lessen this love.”

<p class="dropcap-pic">Goethe, that universal genius, has
some excellent thoughts on this subject;
speaking of Winckelmann he
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“The affinities of human beings in Antiquity
give evidence of an important distinction between
ancient and modern times. The relation to
women, which among us has become so tender and
full of meaning, hardly aspired in those days beyond
the limits of vulgar necessity. The relation
of parents to their children seems in some respects
to have been tenderer. More to them than all other
feelings was the friendship between persons of the
male sex (though female friends too, like Chloris
and Thyia, were inseparable, even in Hades). In
these cases of union between two youths, the
passionate fulfilment of loving duties, the joys of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
inseparableness, the devotion of one for the other,
the unavoided companionship in death, fill us with
astonishment; indeed one feels oneself ashamed
when poets, historians, philosophers and orators
overwhelm us with legends, anecdotes, sentiments
and ideas, containing such meaning and feeling.
Winckelmann felt himself <i>born</i> for a friendship of
this kind—not only as capable of it, but in the
highest degree in need of it; he became conscious
of his true self only under the form of friendship.”

<p class="dropcap-pic">Count August von Platen
(born at Ansbach in Bavaria, 1796)
was in respect of style one of the most
finished and perfect of German poets.
His nature (which was refined and self-controlled)
led him from the first to form the most romantic
attachments with men. He freely and openly expressed
his feelings in his verses; of which a great
number are practically love-poems addressed to his
friends. They include a series of twenty-six sonnets
to one of his friends, Karl Theodor German. Of
these Raffalovich says (<i>Uranisme</i>, Lyons, 1896,
p. 351):—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“These sonnets to Karl Theodor German are
among the most beautiful in German literature.
Platen in the sonnet surpasses all the German
poets, including even Goethe. In them perfection
of form, and poignancy or wealth of emotion are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
illustrated to perfection. The sentiment is similar

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">The correspondence of Richard Wagner
discloses the existence of a very
warm friendship between him and
Ludwig II., the young king of Bavaria.
Ludwig as a young man appears to have been
a very charming personality, good looking, engaging
and sympathetic; everyone was fond of him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
Yet his tastes led him away from “society,” into retirement,
and the companionship of Nature and
a few chosen friends—often of humble birth. Already
at the age of fifteen he had heard Lohengrin,
and silently vowed to know the composer. One of
his first acts when he came to the throne was to send
for Wagner; and from the moment of their meeting
a personal intimacy sprang up between them, which
in due course led to the establishment of the theatre
at Bayreuth, and to the liberation of Wagner’s
genius to the world. Though the young king at
a later time lost his reason—probably owing to his
over-sensitive emotional nature—this does not detract
from the service that he rendered to Music by
his generous attachment. How Wagner viewed the
matter may be gathered from Wagner’s letters.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“He, the king, loves me, and with the deep
feeling and glow of a first love; he perceives
and knows everything about me, and understands

always.... I am to be free and my own master, not

the impression that dream made on me. Then
I would have wished to see Beethoven, though he
was already dead. Something of the same kind
must pass in the mind of this lovable man when
with me. He says he can hardly believe that he
really possesses me. None can read without astonishment,
without enchantment, the letters he

<p class="dropcap-pic">In these letters we see chiefly of course
the passionate sentiments of which
Ludwig was capable; but that Wagner
fully understood the feeling and
appreciated it may be gathered from various passages
in his published writings—such as the following,
in which he seeks to show how the devotion of
comradeship became the chief formative influence
of the Spartan State:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“This beauteous naked man is the kernel of all
Spartanhood; from genuine delight in the
beauty of the most perfect human body—that of
the male—arose that spirit of comradeship which
pervades and shapes the whole economy of the
Spartan State. This love of man to man, in its
primitive purity, proclaims itself as the noblest and
least selfish utterance of man’s sense of beauty, for
it teaches man to sink and merge his entire self in
the object of his affection;” and again:—“The
higher element of that love of man to man consisted
even in this: that it excluded the motive of egoistic
physicalism. Nevertheless it not only included a
purely spiritual bond of friendship, but this spiritual
friendship was the blossom and the crown of
the physical friendship. The latter sprang directly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
from delight in the beauty, aye in the material
bodily beauty of the beloved comrade; yet this delight
was no egoistic yearning, but a thorough
stepping out of self into unreserved sympathy
with the comrade’s joy in himself; involuntarily
betrayed by his life-glad beauty-prompted bearing.
This love, which had its basis in the noblest pleasures
of both eye and soul—not like our modern
postal correspondence of sober friendship, half business-like,
half sentimental—was the Spartan’s only
tutoress of youth, the never-ageing instructress
alike of boy and man, the ordainer of common
feasts and valiant enterprises; nay the inspiring
helpmeet on the battlefield. For this it was that
knit the fellowship of love into battalions of war,
and fore-wrote the tactics of death-daring, in rescue
of the imperilled or vengeance for the slaughtered
comrade, by the infrangible law of the soul’s
most natural necessity.” <i>The Art-work of the Future</i>,

</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">To return to England. With the beginning
of the 19th century we find two
great poets, Byron and Shelley, both
interested in and even writing in a
romantic strain on the subject in question.</p>

<p>Byron’s attachment, when at Cambridge, to Eddleston
the chorister, a youth two years younger than
himself, is well known. In a youthful letter to Miss
Pigot he, Byron, speaks of it in enthusiastic terms:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“Trin. Coll., Camb., <i>July</i> 5th, 1807.</p>

<p class="dropcap">“I rejoice to hear you are interested in my protégé;
he has been my <i>almost constant</i> associate
since October, 1805, when I entered Trinity College.
His <i>voice</i> first attracted my attention, his
<i>countenance</i> fixed it, and his <i>manners</i> attached me to
him for ever. He departs for a mercantile house in
town in October, and we shall probably not meet
till the expiration of my minority, when I shall
leave to his decision either entering as a partner
through my interest or residing with me altogether.
Of course he would in his present frame of
mind prefer the latter, but he may alter his opinion
previous to that period; however he shall have his
choice. I certainly love him more than any human
being, and neither time nor distance have had the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
least effect on my (in general) changeable disposition.
In short we shall put Lady E. Butler and
Miss Ponsonby to the blush, Pylades and Orestes
out of countenance, and want nothing but a catastrophe
like Nisus and Euryalus to give Jonathan
and David the ‘go by.’ He certainly is more attached
to <i>me</i> than even I am in return. During the
whole of my residence at Cambridge we met every
day, summer and winter, without passing <i>one</i> tiresome
moment, and separated each time with increasing
reluctance.”</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Adieu</i></div>

<p>Eddleston gave Byron a cornelian (brooch-pin)
which Byron prized much, and is said to have kept
all his life. He probably refers to it, and to the inequality
of condition between him and Eddleston,
in the following stanza from his poem, <i>The Adieu</i>,
written about this time:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0 dropcap">“And thou, my friend, whose gentle love</div>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">The Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss
Sarah Ponsonby mentioned in the
above letter were at that time living
at Llangollen, in Wales, and were
known as the “Ladies of Llangollen,” their romantic
attachment to each other having already become
proverbial. When Miss Ponsonby was seventeen,
and Lady E. Butler some twenty years older, they
had run away from their respective and respectable
homes in Ireland, and taking a cottage at Llangollen
lived there, inseparable companions, for the rest
of their lives. Letters and diaries of contemporary
celebrities mention their romantic devotion. (The
Duke of Wellington was among their visitors.)
Lady Eleanor died in 1829, at the age of ninety;
and Miss Ponsonby only survived her “beloved
one” (as she always called her) by two years.</p>

<p class="noindent">Byron’s friendships, in fact, with young men were

to some extent, to explain them:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“During his stay in Greece (in 1810) we find
him forming one of those extraordinary
friendships—if attachment to persons so inferior
to himself can be called by that name—of which
I have already mentioned two or three instances
in his younger days, and in which the pride of
being a protector and the pleasure of exciting gratitude
seem to have contributed to his mind the
chief, pervading charm. The person whom he now
adopted in this manner, and from similar feelings
to those which had inspired his early attachments
to the cottage boy near Newstead and the young
chorister at Cambridge, was a Greek youth, named<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
Nicolo Giraud, the son, I believe, of a widow lady

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“I remember forming an attachment of this
kind at school. I cannot recall to my memory
the precise epoch at which this took place; but
I imagine it must have been at the age of eleven or
twelve. The object of these sentiments was a boy
about my own age, of a character eminently generous,
brave and gentle, and the elements of human
feeling seemed to have been, from his birth, genially
compounded within him. There was a delicacy
and a simplicity in his manners, inexpressibly attractive.
It has never been my fortune to meet with
him since my schoolboy days; but either I confound
my present recollections with the delusions
of past feelings, or he is now a source of honour
and utility to everyone around him. The tones of
his voice were so soft and winning, that every
word pierced into my heart; and their pathos was
so deep that in listening to him the tears have involuntarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
gushed from my eyes. Such was the
being for whom I first experienced the sacred
sentiments of friendship.”</p>

<p class="dropcap-pic">With this passage we may compare
the following from Leigh Hunt:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“If I had reaped no other benefit
from Christ Hospital, the school
would be ever dear to me from the
recollection of the friendships I formed in it, and
of the first heavenly taste it gave me of that most
spiritual of the affections.... If ever I tasted a
disembodied transport on earth, it was in those
friendships which I entertained at school, before
I dreamt of any maturer feeling. I shall never forget
the impression it made on me. I loved my
friend for his gentleness, his candour, his truth,
his good repute, his freedom even from my own
livelier manner, his calm and reasonable kindness.
It was not any particular talent that attracted me
to him, or anything striking whatsoever. I should
say, in one word, it was his goodness. I doubt
whether he ever had a conception of a tithe of the
regard and respect I entertained for him; and
I smile to think of the perplexity (though he never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
showed it) which he probably felt sometimes at my
enthusiastic expressions; for I thought him a kind
of angel. It is no exaggeration to say, that, take
away the unspiritual part of it—the genius and the
knowledge—and there is no height of conceit indulged
in by the most romantic character in Shakespeare,
which surpassed what I felt towards the
merits I ascribed to him, and the delight which
I took in his society. With the other boys I played
antics, and rioted in fantastic jests; but in his
society, or whenever I thought of him, I fell into
a kind of Sabbath state of bliss; and I am sure
I could have died for him.</p>

<p>“I experienced this delightful affection towards
three successive schoolfellows, till two of them had
for some time gone out into the world and forgotten
me; but it grew less with each, and in more
than one instance became rivalled by a new set of
emotions, especially in regard to the last, for I fell
in love with his sister—at least, I thought so. But
on the occurrence of her death, not long after,
I was startled at finding myself assume an air of
greater sorrow than I felt, and at being willing to
be relieved by the sight of the first pretty face that
turned towards me.... My friend, who died himself
not long after his quitting the University, was
of a German family in the service of the court, very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>

which notwithstanding its sentimental
setting may be worth quoting; because,
after all, it signalises an often-forgotten or unconsidered
aspect of school-life:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“At school, friendship is a passion. It entrances
the being; it tears the soul. All loves of after-life
can never bring its rapture, or its wretchedness;
no bliss so absorbing, no pangs of jealousy
or despair so crushing and so keen! What tenderness
and what devotion; what illimitable confidence,
infinite revelations of inmost thoughts;
what ecstatic present and romantic future; what
bitter estrangements and what melting reconciliations;
what scenes of wild recrimination, agitating
explanations, passionate correspondence; what
insane sensitiveness, and what frantic sensibility;
what earthquakes of the heart and whirlwinds of
the soul are confined in that simple phrase, a
schoolboy’s friendship!”</p>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Alfred Tennyson, in his great
poem <i>In Memoriam</i>, published about
the middle of the 19th century, gives
superb expression to his love for his
lost friend, Arthur Hallam. Reserved, dignified, in
sustained meditation and tender sentiment, yet half
revealing here and there a more passionate feeling;
expressing in simplest words the most difficult and
elusive thoughts (<i>e.g.</i>, Cantos 128 and 129), as well
as the most intimate and sacred moods of the soul;
it is indeed a great work of art. Naturally, being
such, it was roundly abused by the critics on its
first appearance. The <i>Times</i> solemnly rebuked its
language as unfitted for any but amatory tenderness,
and because young Hallam was a barrister
spent much wit upon the poet’s “Amaryllis of the
Chancery bar.” Tennyson himself, speaking of
<i>In Memoriam</i>, mentioned (see <i>Memoir</i> by his son,
p. 800) “the number of shameful letters of abuse
he had received about it!”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Between Browning and Whitman
we may insert a few lines from R. W.
Emerson:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“The only way to have a friend
is to be one.... In the last
analysis love is only the reflection of a man’s own
worthiness from other men. Men have sometimes
exchanged names with their friends, as if they
would signify that in their friend each loved his
own soul.</p>

<p>“The higher the style we demand of friendship,
of course the less easy to establish it with flesh and
blood.... Friends, such as we desire, are dreams
and fables. But a sublime hope cheers ever the
faithful heart, that elsewhere, in other regions of
the universal power, souls are now acting, enduring,
and daring, which can love us, and which
we can love.” <i>Essay on Friendship.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Henry D. Thoreau</i></div>

<p>These also from Henry D. Thoreau:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“No word is oftener on the lips of men than
Friendship, and indeed no thought is more
familiar to their aspirations. All men are dreaming
of it, and its drama, which is always a tragedy, is
enacted daily. It is the secret of the universe. You
may thread the town, you may wander the country,
and none shall ever speak of it, yet thought is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
everywhere busy about it, and the idea of what is
possible in this respect affects our behaviour towards
all new men and women, and a great many
old ones. Nevertheless I can remember only two
or three essays on this subject in all literature....
To say that a man is your friend, means commonly
no more than this, that he is not your enemy.
Most contemplate only what would be the accidental
and trifling advantages of friendship, as
that the friend can assist in time of need, by his
substance, or his influence, or his counsel; but
he who foresees such advantages in this relation
proves himself blind to its real advantage, or indeed
wholly inexperienced in the relation itself....
What is commonly called Friendship is only
a little more honour among rogues. But sometimes
we are said to <i>love</i> another, that is, to
stand in a true relation to him, so that we give the
best to, and receive the best from, him. Between
whom there is hearty truth there is love; and in
proportion to our truthfulness and confidence in
one another our lives are divine and miraculous,
and answer to our ideal. There are passages of
affection in our intercourse with mortal men and
women, such as no prophecy had taught us to expect,
which transcend our earthly life, and anticipate
heaven for us.” <i>From On the Concord River.</i></p>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">I conclude this collection with
a few quotations from Whitman, for
whom “the love of comrades” perhaps
stands as the most intimate part
of his message to the world—“Here the frailest
leaves of me and yet my strongest lasting.” Whitman,
by his great power, originality and initiative,
as well as by his deep insight and wide vision, is in
many ways the inaugurator of a new era to mankind;
and it is especially interesting to find that this
idea of comradeship, and of its establishment as a
<i>social institution</i>, plays so important a part with him.
We have seen that in the Greek age, and more or
less generally in the ancient and pagan world, comradeship
was an institution; we have seen that in
Christian and modern times, though existent, it was
socially denied and ignored, and indeed to a great
extent fell under a kind of ban; and now Whitman’s
attitude towards it suggests to us that it really is
destined to pass into its third stage, to arise again,
and become a recognised factor of modern life, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
even in a more extended and perfect form than
at first.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“It is to the development, identification, and
general prevalence of that fervid comradeship
(the adhesive love, at least rivaling the amative
love hitherto possessing imaginative literature, if
not going beyond it), that I look for the counterbalance
and offset of our materialistic and vulgar
American Democracy, and for the spiritualisation
thereof. Many will say it is a dream, and will not
follow my inferences; but I confidently expect a
time when there will be seen, running like a half-hid
warp through all the myriad audible and visible
worldly interests of America, threads of manly
friendship, fond and loving, pure and sweet, strong
and lifelong, carried to degrees hitherto unknown—not
only giving tone to individual character, and
making it unprecedently emotional, muscular, heroic,
and refined, but having deepest relations to
general politics. I say Democracy infers such
loving comradeship, as its most inevitable twin or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
counterpart, without which it will be incomplete,
in vain, and incapable of perpetuating itself.”

<p class="dropcap">“Friendship is a thing most
necessary to life, since without
friends no one would choose to
live, though possessed of all other
advantages.”... “Since then his own life is,
to a good man, a thing naturally sweet and ultimately
desirable, for a similar reason is the life of
his friend agreeable to him, and delightful merely
on its own account, and without reference to any
object beyond it; and to live without friends is
to be destitute of a good, unconditioned, absolute,
and in itself desirable; and therefore to be
deprived of one of the most solid and most

Theban statesmen and generals, were
celebrated for their devotion to each
other. In a battle (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 385) against
the Arcadians, Epaminondas is said to have saved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
his friend’s life. Plutarch in his Life of Pelopidas
relates of them:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Epaminondas and he were both born
with the same dispositions to all kinds of
virtues, but Pelopidas took more pleasure in the
exercises of the body, and Epaminondas in the
improvements of the mind; so that they spent
all their leisure time, the one in hunting, and
the palestra, the other in learned conversation,
and the study of philosophy. But of all the
famous actions for which they are so much celebrated,
the judicious part of mankind reckon
none so great and glorious as that strict friendship
which they inviolably preserved through the
whole course of their lives, in all the high posts
they held, both military and civil.... For
being both in that battle, near one another in the
infantry, and fighting against the Arcadians, that
wing of the Lacedæmonians in which they were,
gave way and was broken; which Pelopidas and
Epaminondas perceiving, they joined their shields,
and keeping close together, bravely repulsed all
that attacked them, till at last Pelopidas, after
receiving seven large wounds, fell upon a heap
of friends and enemies that lay dead together.
Epaminondas, though he believed him slain, advanced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
before him to defend his body and arms,
and for a long time maintained his ground against
great numbers of the Arcadians, being resolved
to die rather than desert his companion and leave
him in the enemy’s power; but being wounded
in his breast by a spear, and in his arm by a
sword, he was quite disabled and ready to fall,
when Agesipolis, king of the Spartans, came from
the other wing to his relief, and beyond all
expectation saved both their lives.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“When Hephæstion died at Ecbatana (in
324) Alexander placed his weapons upon
the funeral pyre, with gold and silver for the
dead man, and a robe—which last, among the
Persians is a symbol of great honour. He shore
off his own hair, as in Homeric grief, and behaved
like the Achilles of Homer. Indeed he
acted more violently and passionately than the
latter, for he caused the towers and strongholds of
Ecbatana to be demolished all round. As long as
he only dedicated his own hair, he was behaving,
I think, like a Greek; but when he laid hands
on the very walls, Alexander was already showing
his grief in foreign fashion. Even in his clothing
he departed from ordinary custom, and gave
himself up to his mood, his love, and his tears.”</p>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Beaumont and Fletcher are two
names which time and immortal
friendship have sealed in one. Francis
Beaumont was son of a judge,
and John Fletcher, who was some
four or five years the elder of the two, son of a
bishop. The one went to Oxford, the other to
Cambridge. Both took to writing at an early age;
they probably met at the Mermaid Tavern, about
the year 1604, and a friendship sprang up between
them of the closest character. “The intimacy
which now commenced was one of singular warmth
even for that romantic age.” (Chambers’ Biog.
Dict.) For many years they lived in the same house
as bachelors, writing plays together, and sharing
everything in common. Then in 1613 Beaumont
married, but died in 1616. Fletcher lived on
unmarried, till 1625, when he died of the plague.</p>

<p>J. St. L. Strachey, in his introduction to the
works of Beaumont and Fletcher in the Mermaid
Series, says:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“In the whole range of English literature, search
it from Chaucer till to-day, there is no figure
more fascinating or more worthy of attention
than ‘the mysterious double personallity’ of Beaumont
and Fletcher. Whether we bow to the
sentiment of the first Editor, who, though he
knew the secret of the poets, yet since never
parted while they lived’ conceived it not equitable
to ‘separate their ashes,’ and so refuse to think
of them apart; whether we adopt the legendary
union of the comrade-poets who dwelt on the
Bank-side, who lived and worked together, their
thoughts no less in common than the cloak and
bed o’er which tradition has grown fond; whether
we think of them as two minds so married that
to divorce or disunite them were a sacrilegious
deed; or whether we yield to the subtler influences
of the critical fancy, and delight to
discover and explore each from its source, the
twin fountains of inspiration that feed the majestic
stream of song that flows through ‘The Lost
Aspatia’s’ tragedy, etc. ... whether we treat
the poets as a mystery to which love and sympathy
are the initiation, or as a problem for the
tests and reagents of critical analysis to solve,
the double name of Beaumont and Fletcher will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
ever strike the fancy and excite the imagination
as does no other name in the annals of English
song.”</p>

<p>George Varley, in his Introduction to the

says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“The story of their common life, which scandalises
some biographers, contains much
that is agreeable to me, as offering a picture of
perfect union whose heartiness excuses its homeliness
... but when critics would explain away
the community of cloak and clothes by accident
or slander, methinks their fastidiousness exceeds
their good feeling.”</p>

him. Fletcher delighted to do him honour and

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">The devotion of Vauvenargues to
his friend De Seytres is immortalized
by the <i>éloge</i> he wrote on
the occasion of the latter’s death.
V., a youth of noble family, born
in S. France in 1715, entered military service
and the regiment of the King at an early age.
He seems to have been a gentle, wise character,
much beloved by his comrades. During the French
invasion of Bohemia, in 1741, when he was about
26, he met Hippolyte de Seytres, who belonged to
the same regiment, and who was only 18 years of
age. A warm friendship sprang up between the
two, but lasted for a brief time only. De Seytres
died during the privations of the terrible Siege of
Prague in 1742. Vauvenargues escaped, but with
the loss of his health, as well as of his friend. He
took to literature, and wrote some philosophic
works, and became correspondent and friend of
Voltaire, but died in 1747 at the early age of 32.
In his <i>éloge</i> he speaks of his friend as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“By nature full of grace, his movements natural,
his manners frank, his features noble and
grave, his expression sweet and penetrating; one
could not look upon him with indifference.
From the first his loveable exterior won all
hearts in his favour, and whoever was in the
position to know his character could not but
admire the beauty of his disposition. Never did
he despise or envy or hate anyone. He understood
all the passions and opinions, even the
most singular, that the world blames. They
did not surprise him; he penetrated their cause,
and found in his own reflexions the means of
explaining them.”</p>

<p>“And so Hippolyte,” he continues, “I was
destined to be the survivor in our friendship—just
when I was hoping that it would mitigate
all the sufferings and ennui of my life even to
my latest breath. At the moment when my
heart, full of security, placed blind confidence in
thy strength and youth, and abandoned itself to
gladness—O Misery! in that moment a mighty
hand was extinguishing the sources of life in thy
blood. Death was creeping into thy heart, and
harbouring in thy bosom!... O pardon
me once more; for never canst thou have doubted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
the depth of my attachment. I loved thee before
I was able to know thee. I have never loved
but thee ... I was ignorant of thy very
name and life, but my heart adored thee, spoke
with thee, saw thee and sought thee in solitude.
Thou knewest me but for a moment; and when
we did become acquainted, already a thousand
times had I paid homage in secret to thy virtues....
Shade worthy of heaven, whither hast
thou fled! Do my sighs reach thee? I tremble—O
abyss profound, O woe, O death, O grave!
Dark veil and viewless night, and mystery of
Eternity!”</p>

</div>

<p>(It is said that Vauvenargues thought more of
this memorial inscription to his friend than of any
other of his works, and constantly worked at and
perfected it.)</p>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Schiller, the great German poet,
had an enthusiastic appreciation of
friendship-love, as can be seen from
his poems “Freundschaft” and “Die
Burgschaft,” and others of his writings.
His tragedy Don Karlos turns upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
death of one friend for the sake of another. The
young Infanta of Spain, Don Karlos, alienated by
the severities of his father, Phillip II., enters into
plots and intrigues, from the consequences of
which he is only saved by his devoted companion,
the Marquis of Posa, who, by making himself out
the guilty party, dies in the Prince’s stead. Early

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">There is little, I believe, in the
historical facts relating to Don
Karlos to justify this tale of friendship;
but there seems great probability
that the incidents were transferred by Schiller
from the history of Frederick the Great, of Prussia,
when a youth at his father’s court. The devotion
that existed between the young Frederick and
Lieut. Von Katte, the anger and severities of the
royal parent, the supposed conspiracy, the emprisonment
of Frederick, and the execution of
Von Katte, are all reproduced in Schiller’s play.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Death of Von Katte</i></div>

<p>Von Katte was a young man of good family
and strange but charming personality, who, as soon
as he came to Court, being three or four years
older than Frederick, exercised a strong attraction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
upon the latter. The two were always together,
and finally, enraged by the harshness of the royal
father, they plotted flight to England. They were
arrested, and Katte, accused of treason to the
throne, was condemned to death. That this sentence
was pronounced, not so much for political
reasons, as in order to do despite to the affection
between him and the Crown Prince, is strongly
suggested by the circumstances. Von Katte was
sent from a distance in order to be executed at
Cüstrin, in the fortress where the Prince was confined,
and with instructions that the latter should
witness his execution. Carlyle, in his life of
Frederick II., says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Katte wore, by order, a brown dress exactly
like the Prince’s; the Prince is already
brought down into a lower room to see Katte as
he passes, (to see Katte die has been the royal
order, but they smuggled that into abeyance) and
Katte knows he shall see him.” [Besserer, the
chaplain of the Garrison, quoted by Carlyle,
describing the scene as they approached the Castle,
says:—‘Here, after long wistful looking about,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
he did get sight of his beloved Jonathan at a
window in the Castle, from whom, he, with
politest and most tender expression, speaking in
French, took leave, with no little emotion of
sorrow.] “<i>Pardonnez moi, mon cher Katte</i>” cried
Friedrich. “<i>La mort est douce pour un si aimable
Prince</i>,” said Katte, and fared on; round some
angle of the Fortress it appears; not in sight of
Friedrich, who sank in a faint, and had seen his
last glimpse of Katte in this world.’</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Frederick the Great</i></div>

<p>Frederick’s grief and despair were extreme for
a time. Then his royal father found him a wife,
in the Princess Elizabeth of Brunswick, whom he
obediently married, but in whom he showed little
interest—their meetings growing rarer and rarer
till at last they became merely formal. Later,
and after his accession, he spent most of his leisure
time when away from the cares of war and political
re-organisation, at his retreat at Sans-Souci, afar
from feminine society (a fact which provoked
Voltaire’s sarcasms), and in the society of his
philosophic and military friends, to many of whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
he was much attached. Von Kupffer has unearthed
from his poems printed at Sans-Souci in 1750 the
following, addressed to Count Von Kaiserlinck,
a favorite companion, on whom he bestowed the
by-name of Cesarion:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="poetry-container">

(1744-1803) as theologian, philosopher,
friend of Goethe, Court
preacher at Weimar, and author of
<i>Ideas on the Philosophy of History</i> has
had a great and enduring reputation. The following
extract is from the just-mentioned book:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“Never has a branch born finer fruit than
that little branch of Olive, Ivy, and Pine,
which was the victor’s crown among the Greeks.
It gave to the young men good looks, good
health, and good spirits; it made their limbs
nimble, graceful and well-formed; in their souls
it lighted the first sparks of the desire for good
name, the love of fame even, and stamped on
them the inviolable temper of men who live for
their city and their country. Finally, what was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
most precious, it laid the foundation in their
characters of that predilection for male society
and friendship which so markedly distinguishes
the Greeks. In Greece, woman was not the one
prize of life for which the young man fought and
strove; the loveliest Helen could only mould the
spirit of one Paris, even though her beauty might
be the coveted object of all manly valour. The
feminine sex, despite the splendid examples of
every virtue that it exhibited in Greece, as elsewhere,
remained there only a secondary object of
the manly life. The thoughts of aspiring youths
reached towards something higher. The bond
of friendship which they knitted among themselves
or with grown men, compelled them into
a school which Aspasia herself could hardly have
introduced them to; so that in many of the
states of Greece manly love became surrounded
and accompanied by those intelligent and educational
influences, that permanence of character
and devotion, whose sentiment and meaning we
read of in Plato almost as if in a romance from
some far planet.”</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-e.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Elisar von Kupffer, in the introduction
to his Anthology, from which I have
already quoted a few extracts, speaks
at some length on the great ethical
and political significance of a loving comradeship.
He says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“In open linkage and attachment to each other
ought youth to rejoice in youth. In attachment
to another, one loses the habit of thinking
only of self. In the love and tender care and
instruction that the youth receives from his lover
he learns from boyhood up to recognise the good
of self-sacrifice and devotion; and in the love
which he shows, whether in the smaller or the
greater offerings of an intimate friendship, he
accustoms himself to self-sacrifice for another.
In this way the young man is early nurtured into
a member of the Community—to a useful member
and not one who has self and only self in mind.
And how much closer thus does unit grow to
unit, till indeed the whole comes to feel itself
a whole!...</p>

<p>“The close relationship between two men has
this further result—that folk instinctively and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
not without reason judge of one from the other;
so that should the one be worthy and honorable,
he naturally will be anxious that the other should
not bring a slur upon him. Thus there arises
a bond of moral responsibility with regard to
character. And what can be of more advantage
to the community than that the individual members
should feel responsible for each other?
Surely it is just that which constitutes national
sentiment, and the strength of a people, namely,
that it should form a complete whole in itself,
where each unit feels locked and linked with the
others. Such unions may be of the greatest
social value, as in the case of the family. And
it is especially in the hour of danger that the
effect of this unity of feeling shows itself; for
where one man stands or falls with another,
where glad self-sacrifice, learnt in boyhood, becomes
so to speak, a warm-hearted instinct, there
is developed a power of incalculable import, a
power that folly alone can hold cheap. Indeed,
the unconquerable force of these unions has
already been practically shown, as in the Sacred
Band of the Thebans who fought to its bitter
end the battle of Leuctra; and, psychologically
speaking, the explanation is most natural; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
where one person feels himself united, body and
soul to another, is it not natural that he should
put forth all his powers in order to help the other,
in order to manifest his love for him in every
way? If any one cannot or will not perceive this
we may indeed well doubt either the intelligence
of his head or the morality of his heart.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Byron’s “Death of Calmar and Orla:
an Imitation of Ossian,” is, like his
“Nisus and Euryalus” (see above,
p. 163), a story of two hero-friends
who, refusing to be separated, die
together in battle:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“In Morven dwelt the chief; a beam of war to
Fingal. His steps in the field were marked
in blood. Lochlin’s sons had fled before his
angry spear; but mild was the eye of Calmar;
soft was the flow of his yellow locks: they
streamed like the meteor of the night. No maid
was the sigh of his soul: his thoughts were
given to friendship—to dark-haired Orla, destroyer
of heroes! Equal were their swords in
battle; but fierce was the pride of Orla—gentle
alone to Calmar. Together they dwelt in the
cave of Oithona.” [Orla is sent by the King on
a mission of danger amid the hosts of the enemy.
Calmar insists on accompanying him, in spite of
all entreaties to the contrary. They are discovered.
A fight ensues, and they are slain.] “Morn
glimmers on the hills: no living foe is seen;
but the sleepers are many; grim they lie on
Erin. The breeze of ocean lifts their locks;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
yet they do not awake. The hawks scream
above their prey.</p>

<p>“Whose yellow locks wave o’er the breast of a
chief? Bright as the gold of the stranger they
mingle with the dark hair of his friend. ’Tis
Calmar: he lies on the bosom of Orla. Theirs
is one stream of blood. Fierce is the look of
gloomy Orla. He breathes not, but his eye is
still aflame. It glares in death unclosed. His
hand is grasped in Calmar’s; but Calmar lives!
He lives, though low. ‘Rise,’ said the King,
‘Rise, son of Mora: ’tis mine to heal the
wounds of heroes. Calmar may yet bound on
the hills of Morven.’</p>

<p>“‘Never more shall Calmar chase the deer of
Morven with Orla,’ said the hero. ‘What were
the chase to me alone? Who should share
the spoils of battle with Calmar? Orla is at rest.
Rough was thy soul, Orla! Yet soft to me as
the dew of morn. It glared on others in lightning:
to me a silver beam of night. Bear my
sword to blue-eyed Mora; let it hang in my
empty hall. It is not pure from blood: but it
could not save Orla. Lay me with my friend.
Raise the song when I am dead.’” [So they are
laid by the stream of Lubar, and four gray stones
mark the dwelling of Orla and Calmar.]</p>

<div>

</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Ernst Hæckel, in his “Visit to Ceylon”
describes the devotion entertained for
him by his Rodiya serving-boy at Belligam,
near Galle. The keeper of the
rest-house at Belligam was an old and philosophically-minded
man, whom Hæckel, from his likeness
to a well known head, could not help calling
by the name of Socrates. And he continues:—</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>His Rodiya Boy</i></div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“It really seemed as though I should be pursued
by the familiar aspects of classical
antiquity from the first moment of my arrival at
my idyllic home. For, as Socrates led me up
the steps of the open central hall of the rest-house,
I saw before me, with uplifted arms in an
attitude of prayer, a beautiful naked brown
figure, which could be nothing else than the
famous statue of the ‘Youth adoring.’ How
surprised I was when the graceful bronze statue
suddenly came to life, and dropping his arms
fell on his knees, and, after raising his black eyes
imploringly to mine, bowed his handsome face so
low at my feet that his long black hair fell on the
floor! Socrates informed me that this boy was a
Pariah, a member of the lowest caste, the Rodiyas,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
who had lost his parents at an early age, so he
had taken pity on him. He was told off to my
exclusive service, had nothing to do the livelong
day but obey my wishes, and was a good boy,
sure to do his duty punctually. In answer to
the question what I was to call my new body-servant,
the old man informed me that his name
was Gamameda. Of course I immediately thought
of Ganymede, for the favorite of Jove himself
could not have been more finely made, or have
had limbs more beautifully proportioned and
moulded. As Gamameda also displayed a peculiar
talent as butler, and never allowed anyone else to
open me a cocoa-nut or offer me a glass of palm
wine, it was no more than right that I should
dub him Ganymede.</p>

<p>“Among the many beautiful figures which move
in the foreground of my memories of the paradise
of Ceylon, Ganymede remains one of my
dearest favorites. Not only did he fulfil his
duties with the greatest attention and conscientiousness,
but he developed a personal attachment
and devotion to me which touched me deeply.
The poor boy, as a miserable outcast of the
Rodiya caste, had been from his birth the object
of the deepest contempt of his fellow-men, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
subjected to every sort of brutality and ill-treatment.
With the single exception of old Socrates,
who was not too gentle with him either, no one
perhaps had ever cared for him in any way. He
was evidently as much surprised as delighted to
find me willing to be kind to him from the first....
I owe many beautiful and valuable contributions
to my museum to Ganymede’s unfailing
zeal and dexterity. With the keen eye, the neat
hand, and the supple agility of the Cinghalese
youth, he could catch a fluttering moth or a
gliding fish with equal promptitude; and his
nimbleness was really amazing, when, out hunting,
he climbed the tall trees like a cat, or scrambled
through the densest jungle to recover the prize
I had killed.” <i>My Visit to Ceylon</i>, <i>by Ernst
Hæckel</i>, p. 200. (Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co.,
1883).</p>

</div>

<p>Hæckel stayed some weeks in and around
Belligam; and continues, (p. 272):—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“On my return to Belligam I had to face one
of the hardest duties of my whole stay in
Ceylon: to tear myself away from this lovely
spot of earth, where I had spent six of the
happiest and most interesting weeks in my life....
But hardest of all was the parting from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
my faithful Ganymede; the poor lad wept
bitterly, and implored me to take him with me
to Europe. In vain had I assured him that it
was impossible, and told him of our chill climate
and dull skies. He clung to my knees and
declared that he would follow me unhesitatingly
wherever I would take him. I was at last almost
obliged to use force to free myself from his
embrace. I got into the carriage which was
waiting, and as I waved a last farewell to my
good brown friends, I almost felt as if I had been
expelled from Paradise.”</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-e.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-pic">Edward Fitzgerald, the interpreter and
translator of <i>Omar Khayyam</i>, was a man
of the deepest feeling and sensibility,
with a special gift for friendship. Men
like Tennyson and Thackeray declared that they
loved him best of all their friends. He himself
said in one of his letters “My friendships are
more like loves.” A. C. Benson, his biographer,
writes of him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“He was always taking fancies, and once under
the spell he could see no faults in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
friend. His friendship for Browne arose out of
one of these romantic impulses. So too his
affection for Posh, the boatman; for Cowell, and
for Alfred Smith, the farmer of Farlingay and
Boulge, who had been his protégé as a boy. He
seems to have been one of those whose best
friendships are reserved for men; for though
he had beloved women friends like Mrs. Cowell
and Mrs. Kemble, yet these are the exceptions
rather than the rule. The truth is, there was a
strong admixture of the feminine in Fitzgerald’s
character.” <i>Fitzgerald, English Men of Letters
Series</i>, ch. viii.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Fitzgerald and Posh</i></div>

<p>The friendship with Posh, the fisherman, at
Lowestoft and at Woodbridge, lasted over many
years. Fitzgerald had a herring-lugger built for
him, which he called the <i>Meum and Tuum</i>, and in
which they had many a sail together. Benson,
speaking of their first meeting, says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="dropcap">“In the same year [1864] came another great
friendship. He made the acquaintance of a
stalwart sailor named Joseph Fletcher, commonly
called Posh. It was at Lowestoft that he was
found, where Fitzgerald used, as he wrote in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
1850, ‘to wander about the shore at night longing
for some fellow to accost me who might give
some promise of filling up a very vacant place
in my heart.’ Posh had seen the melancholy
figure wandering about, and years after, when
Fitz used to ask him why he had not been
merciful enough to speak to him, Posh would
reply that he had not thought it becoming.
Posh was, in Fitzgerald’s own words, ‘a man of
the finest Saxon type, with a complexion, <i>vif,
mâle et flamboyant</i>, blue eyes, a nose less than
Roman, more than Greek, and strictly auburn
hair that woman might sigh to possess.’ He
was too, according to Fitz, ‘a man of simplicity
of soul, justice of thought, tenderness of nature,
a gentleman of Nature’s grandest type.’ Fitz
became deeply devoted to this big-handed, soft-hearted,
grave fellow, then 24 years of age.”</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
